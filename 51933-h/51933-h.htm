<p class="pc4 xlarge">TOMMY SMITH’S ANIMALS</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="small">THE MEETING</span></h2>

<p class="pp6q">“<i>The owl calls a meeting, and has an idea:<br />
They all think it good, though it SOUNDS rather queer.</i>”</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THERE was once a little boy, named
Tommy Smith, who was very cruel
to animals, because nobody had taught
him that it was wrong to be so. He would
throw stones at the birds as they sat in the
trees or hedges; and if he did not hit them,
that was only because they were too quick
for him, and flew away as soon as they saw
the stone coming. But he always <i>meant</i>
to hit them&mdash;yes, and to kill them too,&mdash;which
made it every bit as bad as if he
really had killed them. Then, if he saw a
rat, he would make his dog run after it,
and if the poor thing tried to escape by
running down a hole, he and the dog together
would dig it out, and then the dog<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
would bite it with his sharp teeth until it
was quite dead. It never seemed to occur
to this boy that the poor rat had done <i>him</i>
no harm, and that it might be the father or
mother of some little baby rats, who would
now die of hunger. Even if the rat got
away, he would whip the dog for not
catching it, yet the dog had done his best;
for, of course, dogs must do what their
masters tell them, and cannot know any
better. It was just the same with hares
or rabbits, squirrels, rooks, or partridges.
Indeed, this boy could not see any
animal playing about, and doing no
harm, without trying to frighten it or to
hurt it.</p>

<p>When the spring came, and the birds
began to build their nests, and to lay their
pretty eggs in them, then it is dreadful to
think how cruel this Tommy Smith was.
He would look about amongst the trees
and bushes, and when he had found a nest,
he would take all the eggs that were in it,
and not leave even one for the poor mother
bird to sit on when she came back. Indeed,
he would often tear down the nest too,
after he had taken the eggs. Perhaps you
will wonder what he did with these eggs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
Well, when he had brought them home
and shown them to his father and mother,
who never thought of scolding him, or to
his little brothers and sisters (for he was
the eldest of the family), he would throw
them away, and think no more about them.
If he had left them in the nest, then out of
each pretty little egg would have come a
pretty little bird. But now, for every egg
he had taken away, there was one bird less
to sing in the woods in the spring and
summer.</p>

<p>At last this boy became such a nuisance
to all the animals round about, that they
determined to punish him in some way or
other. They thought the first thing to do
was for all of them to meet together and
have a good talk about it. In a wood, not far
off, there was a nice open space where the
ground was smooth and covered with moss.
Here they all agreed to come one fine
night, for they thought it would be nice
and quiet then, and that nobody would
disturb them, as, perhaps, they might do
in the daytime.</p>

<p>So, as soon as the moon rose, they began
to assemble, and I wish you could have
been there too, to see them all come, sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
one at a time, and sometimes two or
three together.</p>

<p>The rat was one of the first to arrive,
and then came the hare and the rabbit
arm in arm, for they knew each other well,
and were very good friends. The frog was
late, for he had had a good way to hop
from the nearest pond, where he lived, so
that his cousin, the toad, who was slower,
but lived nearer, got there before him.
The snake had no need to make a journey
at all, for he lived under a bush just on the
edge of the open space. All the little
birds, too, had gone to roost in the trees
and bushes close by, so as to be ready in
good time; and, when the moon rose, they
drew out their heads from under their
wings, and were wide awake in a moment.
The rook and the partridge, and other
large birds, were there as well, and the
squirrel sat with his tail over his head, on
the branch of a small fir tree. Then there
were weasels, and lizards, and hedgehogs,
and slow-worms, and many other animals
besides.</p>

<p>In fact, if you had seen them all together,
you would have wondered how one little
boy could have found time to plague and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
worry so many different creatures. But
you must remember that even a very <i>little</i>
boy can do a <i>great</i> deal of mischief. Perhaps
there were some animals there that
little Tommy Smith had not hurt, because
he had not yet seen them, but these came
because they knew he <i>would</i> hurt them as
soon as he could; and, besides, they were
angry because their friends and companions
had been ill-treated by him.</p>

<p>At last it seemed as if there was nobody
else to come, and that everything was
ready. Still, they seemed waiting for
something, and all at once a great owl
came swooping down, and settled on a
large mole-hill which was just in the
middle of the open space. Now, the owl,
as perhaps you know, is a very wise bird,
and, for this reason, all the other animals
had chosen him to be the chief at their
meeting, and to decide what was best to
be done, in case they should not agree
amongst themselves. He at once showed
<i>how</i> wise he was, by saying that before he
gave his own opinion he would hear what
everybody else had to say. Then everybody
began to talk at once, and there was
a great hubbub, until the owl said that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
only one should speak at a time, and that
the hare had better begin, because he was
the largest of all the animals there.</p>

<p>So the hare stood up, and said he
thought the best way to punish Tommy
Smith was for every one of them to do
him what harm he could. For his part,
he was only a timid animal, and not at
all accustomed to hurt people. Still,
he had very sharp teeth, and he thought
he might be able to jump as high
as Tommy Smith’s face and give him a
good bite on the cheek or ear, and then
run off so quickly that nobody could catch
him. The rabbit spoke next, and said
that he was just as timid as the hare, and
not so strong or so swift. All <i>he</i> could do
was to go on digging holes, and he hoped
that some day Tommy Smith would fall
into one of them. The hedgehog then got
up, and said he would hide himself in one
of these holes and put up his prickles for
Tommy Smith to fall on. This would be
sure to hurt him, and perhaps it might
even put one of his eyes out. The rat
thought it would be better if the hedgehog
were to get into Tommy Smith’s bed,
so as to prick him all over when he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
undressed; but the hedgehog would not
agree to this, as he did not understand
houses, and thought he would be sure to
be caught if he went into one.</p>

<p>“Well, then,” said the rat, “if you are
afraid I will go myself, for I know the way
about, and am not at all frightened. In
the middle of the night, when it is quite
dark, and when Tommy Smith is fast
asleep, I will creep up the stairs and
into his room, and then I can run up
the counterpane to the foot of his bed
and bite his toes.”</p>

<p>“Why his toes?” said the weasel. “<i>I</i>
can do much better than that, and if you
will only show me the way into his room,
I will bite the veins of his throat, and then
he will soon bleed to death.”</p>

<p>“That would be taking too much
trouble,” said the adder, coming from
under his bush. “You all know that <i>my</i>
bite is poisonous. Well, I know where
this bad boy goes out walking, so I will
just hide myself somewhere near, and
when he comes by I will spring out and
bite his ankle. Then he will soon die.”</p>

<p>The birds, too, had different things to
suggest. Some said they would scratch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Tommy Smith’s face with their claws, and
others that they would peck his eyes out.
The frog wanted to hop down his throat
and choke him, and the lizard was ready
to crawl up his back and tickle him, if they
thought <i>that</i> would do any good.</p>

<p>At length, when everyone else had
spoken, the owl called for silence, and
then he gave his own opinion in these
words:&mdash;“I have now heard what every
animal has had to say, and I have no
doubt that we could easily hurt this boy
very much, or perhaps even kill him,
if we really tried to. But would it not
be a better plan, first to see if we cannot
make little Tommy Smith a better boy?
Many little boys are unkind to animals
because they know nothing about them,
and think that they are stupid and useless.
If they knew how clever we all of us really
are, and what a lot of good we do, I do
not think they would be unkind to us
any more. I am sure that they would
then have quite a friendly feeling towards
us. But they cannot know this without
being taught. Tommy Smith’s father and
mother <i>ought</i>, of course, to teach him, but
as they will not do so, why should not
we teach him ourselves? To do this, we
shall have to speak to him in his own
language, as he does not understand ours;
but that is not such a difficult matter to
us animals. I myself can speak it quite
well when I want to, for I often sit on
the trees near old houses at night, or even
on the houses themselves, and I can hear
the conversations coming up through the
chimneys. That is why I am so wise.
So I can easily teach all of you enough
of it to make <i>you</i> able to talk to a little
boy. My idea, then, is to <i>teach</i> little
Tommy Smith before we begin to <i>punish</i>
him, and it will be quite as easy to do
the one as the other. Only let the next
animal that he is going to kill or throw
stones at, call out to him, and tell him
not to do so. This will surprise him so
much that he will be sure to leave off,
and then each of us can tell him something
about ourselves in turn. In this way
he will get such a high idea of all of us,
that he will never annoy us any more, but
treat us with great respect for the future.”</p>

<p>All the other animals thought this was
a very clever idea of the owl’s, and they
agreed to do what he said, before trying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
anything else. So they begged him
to begin teaching them the little-boy
language at once (all except the rat, for
he knew it too), so that they should
lose no time. This the owl was quite
ready to do, and he taught them so
well, and they all learnt so quickly, that
when little Tommy Smith got up next
morning to have his breakfast, there was
hardly an animal in the whole country
that was not able to talk to him.</p>

<span class="small">THE FROG AND THE TOAD</span></h2>

<p class="pp6q p1">“<i>Tommy Smith takes a turn in the garden next day,<br />
And he finds the frog ready with something to say.</i>”
</p>

<p class="drop-cap16">AS soon as he had had his breakfast,
Tommy Smith went out into the
garden. It had been raining a little, and
the first thing he saw was a large yellow
frog sitting on the wet grass. Tommy
Smith had a stick in his hand, and he at
once lifted it up over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Don’t hit me,” said the frog. “That
would be a <i>very</i> wicked thing to do.”</p>

<p>Tommy Smith was so surprised to hear
a frog speak that he dropped his stick
and stood with both his eyes wide open
for several seconds.</p>

<p>“Why do you want to kill me?” said
the frog.</p>

<p>Tommy Smith thought he must say
something, so he answered, “Because you
are a nasty, stupid frog.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean by
calling me nasty,” said the frog. “Look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
at my bright smooth skin, how nice and
clean it is&mdash;cleaner than your own face, I
daresay, although it is not long since you
have washed it. As for my being stupid,
you see that I can speak your language,
although you cannot speak mine; and
there are lots of other things which I am
able to do, but you are not. I think I
can catch a fly better than you can.”</p>

<p>By this time it seemed to Tommy
Smith as if it was quite natural to be
talking to an animal, so he said, “I never
thought that a frog could catch a fly.”</p>

<p>“You shall see,” said the frog. And
as he spoke a fly settled on a blade of
grass just in front of him. Then all at
once a pink streak seemed to shoot out
of the frog’s mouth; back it came again&mdash;snap!
His mouth, which had been
wide open, was shut once more, and the
fly was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>“Have you caught it?” said Tommy
Smith.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the frog, “and swallowed
it too.”</p>

<p>“But how did you do it?” said Tommy
Smith; “and what was that funny pink
thing that came out of your mouth?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>“That was my tongue,” the frog
answered.</p>

<p>“Your tongue!” cried Tommy Smith.
“But it looked so funny&mdash;not at all like
my own tongue.”</p>

<p>“No,” said the frog. “My tongue is
quite different to yours, and I do not
use it in the same way. Hold out your
hand so that I can hop into it, and then
I will show you all about it.”</p>

<p>Tommy Smith did as he was told, and&mdash;plop!
there was the frog sitting in his
hand. He at once opened his mouth,
which was a very wide one, and allowed
Tommy Smith to look at his tongue.
What a funny tongue it was! It seemed
to be turned backwards, for the tip, which
was forked, instead of being just inside
the lips as it is with us, was right down
the throat, whilst the root of it was where
the tip of our tongue is.</p>

<p>“But how do you use a tongue like
that?” said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Put the tip of your forefinger against
your thumb,” said the frog; “only, first,
you must turn your hand so that the
back of it is towards the ground, and the
palm upwards.” Tommy Smith did so.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
“Now shoot your finger back as hard as
you can.” Tommy Smith did this too.
“That,” said the frog, “is the way I shoot
my tongue out of my mouth when I want
to catch a fly. Like this”&mdash;and he shot
it out again. “You see it flies out like
the lash of a whip, and my aim is so good
that it always hits what I want it to,
whether it is a fly or any other insect.
Then I bring it back, just as you would
bring your finger back to your thumb
again, or as the lash of a whip flies back
when you jerk the handle. The tip of it
goes right down my throat where it was
before, and the fly goes down with it.”</p>

<p>“But why does the fly stay on your
tongue?” said Tommy Smith. “Why
doesn’t it fly away?”</p>

<p>“It would if it could, of course,” said the
frog; “but it can’t. My tongue, you see,
is sticky&mdash;just feel it,&mdash;and so whatever it
touches sticks to it, and comes back with
it, if it isn’t too large.”</p>

<p>“Well, it is very curious,” said Tommy
Smith. “But when you said you could
catch a fly, I did not know that you were
going to eat it too. Then, do you like
flies? and do you eat them every day?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>“I eat them when I can get them,” said
the frog; “but I like them better at night
than in the daytime, if only I can catch
them asleep. <i>You</i> eat during the day, and
go to sleep at night. That is because you
are a little boy. <i>I</i> am a frog, and we
frogs like to be quiet in the daytime, and
come out to feed when it is dark. We
eat all sorts of insects&mdash;beetles, and flies,
and moths, and caterpillars, and we eat
slugs as well, and that is why we are so
useful.”</p>

<p>“Useful?” cried Tommy Smith. “Oh,
I don’t believe that! I am sure that a
frog can be of no use to anybody.”</p>

<p>“If you were a gardener you would
think differently,” said the frog; “at least,
if you were not a very ignorant one.
Have I not told you that I eat slugs and
insects, and do you not know that slugs
and insects eat the leaves of the flowers
and vegetables in your garden? Have
you never seen your father or his gardener
pouring something over his rose-trees to
kill the insects upon them? Now, I eat a
great many insects in a single night, and
I am only <i>one</i> of the frogs in your garden.
There are others there besides me. If we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
were all to be killed, your father would
find it much more difficult to have nice
roses, and he would lose other flowers too,
for there are insects which do harm to all
of them. As for the slugs, if you will go
out some night with a lantern, you may
see them feeding on some of the handsomest
plants, with your own eyes. That
is to say, unless one of us frogs has been
there; for if we have, you will not see any.
Then you have seen caterpillars feeding
on the cabbages. Well, <i>I</i> feed on those
caterpillars. So always remember that
the boy who kills a frog, does harm to his
father’s garden.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to do that,” said Tommy
Smith; “so, if what you say is true”&mdash;</p>

<p>“You can find it in a natural history
book, if you look,” said the frog; “but I
ought to know best myself. And I can
tell you this, that when a frog speaks to a
little boy, he always speaks the truth.”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” said Tommy Smith, “I
will never hurt a frog again.”</p>

<p>How pleased the poor frog was when he
heard that. He gave a great hop out of
Tommy Smith’s hand, and came down
upon the grass again, and then he hopped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
about for a little while, jumping higher
each time than the time before. “Frogs
always speak the truth,” he said,&mdash;“when
they speak to little boys. And now,
perhaps, you would like to learn something
more about me. Ask me any question
you like, and I will answer it, because of
what you have just promised.”</p>

<p>This puzzled Tommy Smith a little,
because he did not know where to begin,
but at last he said, “You seem to me a
very big frog. Were you always as big as
you are now?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course not,” said the frog, “a
frog grows up just as much as a little boy
does. I was once so small that you would
hardly have been able to see me. But,
besides being smaller, I was quite a
different shape to what I am now. I had
no legs at all, but instead of them I had
a long tail, with which I used to swim about
in the water, so that I was much more like
a fish than a frog, and many people would
have thought that I was a fish.”</p>

<p>“That sounds very funny,” said Tommy
Smith.</p>

<p>“But were not you once much smaller
than you are now?” said the frog.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh yes!” Tommy Smith answered,
“but however small I was, I was always
a little boy, and had hands and feet, just
as I have now.”</p>

<p>“With you it is different,” said the frog;
“but there are some animals who are one
thing when they are born, but change into
another as they grow older. It is so with
us frogs, and, if you listen, I will tell you
all about it.”</p>

<p>“Go on,” said Tommy Smith, “I should
like to hear very much.”</p>

<p>“In the nice warm weather,” the frog
continued, “we hop about the country, and
then we like to come into gardens. But
in the winter we go to ponds and ditches
and bury ourselves in the mud at the
bottom, and go to sleep there. In the
early spring, when the weather begins to
get a little warmer, we come up again, and
then the mother frog lays a lot of eggs,
which float about in the water, and look
like a great ball of jelly. After a time,
out of each egg there comes a tiny little
brown thing, and directly it comes out, it
begins to swim about in the water, as well
as if it had had swimming lessons, although,
of course, it has never had any. It soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
grows bigger, and then you can see that it
has a large round head and a long tail, but
you cannot see any legs. But, as it goes
on growing, a small pair of hind legs come
out, one on each side of the tail, and then
every day the tail gets smaller and the
hind legs larger. Still there are no front
legs yet, but at last these come too. The
tail is now quite short, and the head and
body begin to look like a frog’s head and
body, which they did not do before, and
they go on looking more and more like
one, until, at last, the little brown thing
with a tail, that swam about like a fish
in the water, has changed into a little
baby frog, that hops about on the land.
Then this little baby frog grows larger
and larger, until, at last, he becomes a
fine fat frog, as big and as handsome as
I am.”</p>

<p>“It all seems very curious,” said little
Tommy Smith; “and I never knew anything
about it before.”</p>

<p>“That is because nobody ever told you,”
said the frog, “and you have never thought
of finding out for yourself. But have you
not passed by ponds in the spring time
and seen those little brown things with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
tails that I have been telling you about
swimming about in them?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, I have!” said Tommy Smith;
“but I always thought that those were tadpoles.”</p>

<p>“They are tadpoles,” said the frog, “but
they are young frogs for all that. A little
tadpole grows into a big frog, just as a
little boy grows into a big man. So you
see, what a funny life mine has been, and
what a lot of curious things have happened
to me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you have had a funny life, Mr.
Frog,” said Tommy Smith, “and I think
it is very interesting. But is there any
other clever thing you can do besides
catching flies? I can catch flies myself,
but I do it with my hand instead of with
my tongue.”</p>

<p>“I can change my skin,” said the frog,
“and <i>that</i> is something which <i>you</i> cannot
do.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Tommy Smith; “and I do
not believe you can do it either. I think
you are only laughing at me.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the frog, “as it happens,
my skin fits me quite comfortably now,
and is not at all too tight, so I do not want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
to change it yet. But I have a cousin&mdash;a
toad&mdash;who is quite ready to have a new
one. He lives a little way off, in the
shrubbery; so if you would like to see
how he does it, I can bring you to him.
He is very good natured, like myself,
and if you will only promise to leave
off hurting him, as well as me, he will
be very pleased to show you, I am sure.
I must tell you, too, that he is almost as
useful in a garden as I am, for he lives
on the same things, and catches flies and
slugs just as I do.”</p>

<p>“Then isn’t he <i>quite</i> as useful?” said
Tommy Smith; but as the frog didn’t
seem to hear, he went on with&mdash;“Then I
will not hurt him any more than I will
you.”</p>

<p>“Come along, then,” said the frog; and
he began to hop in front of the little boy
until they came to the shrubbery, where, in
the mould beside a laurel bush, there sat a
great, solemn-looking toad.</p>

<p>“I have brought someone to see you,”
said the frog. “This is little Tommy
Smith, who used to be such a bad boy, and
kill every animal he saw; but now he has
promised not to hurt either of us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am glad to hear it,” answered the
toad, “and I hope he will soon learn to
leave other creatures alone too. Well,
what is it he wants?”</p>

<p>“He wants to see you change your
skin,” said the frog.</p>

<p>“He had better look at me, then,” said
the toad, “for that is just what I am
doing.”</p>

<p>Tommy Smith bent down to look, and
then he saw that the toad was wriggling
about in rather a funny way, as if he was a
little uncomfortable. He noticed, too, that
his skin had split along the back, and it
seemed to be wrinkling up and getting
loose all over him, although it had been
too tight before. This loose skin was
dirty and old-looking, but underneath it,
where it was split, Tommy Smith could see
a nice new one that looked ever so much
better. The more the toad wriggled, the
looser the old skin got, and it was soon
plain that he was wriggling himself out of
it, just as you might wriggle your hand out
of an old glove. At last he had got right
out of it, and there lay the old skin on the
ground.</p>

<p>“You see,” said the frog, “that is how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
we change our skin, just as you would
change a suit of clothes. Does he not look
handsome in his new one?”</p>

<p>“Very handsome&mdash;for a toad,” said
Tommy Smith. (The toad only heard
the first two words of this, so he was <i>very</i>
pleased.) “But what is he doing with his
old skin, now that he has got it off?”</p>

<p>“If you wait a little, you will see,” said
the frog.</p>

<p>All this time the toad was pushing his
old skin backwards and forwards with his
two front feet, and he kept on doing this
until, at last, he had rolled it up into a sort
of ball. Then all at once he opened his
great wide mouth and swallowed the ball,
just as if it had been a large pill.</p>

<p>Tommy Smith was so surprised that he
could hardly believe his eyes. “He has
swallowed his own skin!” he cried.</p>

<p>“Of course I have,” said the toad; “and
the best thing to do with it, <i>I</i> think. I
always like to be tidy, and not to leave
things lying about. Now, good-morning,”
and he began to crawl away, for he was
not an <i>idle</i> toad, but had business to
attend to.</p>

<p>“And I have something to see about,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>”
said the frog, “so I will say good-bye, too,
for the present. But remember what you
have promised&mdash;never to hurt a frog or a
toad;” and, with two or three great hops,
he was out of sight.</p>

<p>Tommy Smith stood thinking about it
all for some time, and then he ran into the
house to tell everybody all the wonderful
things he had learnt about frogs and toads,
and to beg them never to kill any, because
they do good in the garden.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="small">THE ROOK</span></h2>

<p class="pp6q">“<i>The rook gives advice which we must not neglect.<br />
I hope that his CAWS will produce an effect.</i>”</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">IT was a nice, fine afternoon, and
Tommy Smith was just going out
for a little walk. He thought he would
take his little terrier dog with him, so he
called, “Pincher! Pincher!” But Pincher
was not there, so he had to go without
him. He was very sorry for this, for when
he had got a little way from the house,
what should run across the road but a rat,
which sat down just inside the hedge and
looked at him. “What a pity,” he said
out loud. “It’s no use my trying to catch
him alone, for he’s sure to get away; but if
Pincher had been with me, we would have
hunted him down together.”</p>

<p>“Then you would have done very
wrong,” said the rat, as he peeped at little
Tommy Smith through the hedge. “You
are a naughty boy yourself, and you teach
Pincher to be a naughty dog.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>“What!” said Tommy Smith; “then can
you talk as well as the frog and toad?”</p>

<p>“Of course I can,” the rat answered;
“and I think if I were to talk to you for a
little while as they did, you would not
wish to hurt <i>me</i> any more either. I am
sure I am just as clever as a frog or a
toad.”</p>

<p>“Can you change your skin like them?”
said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“<i>My</i> skin never wants changing,” said
the rat; “but there are many other things
I can do which are quite as clever as that.”</p>

<p>“Well, do some of them,” said Tommy
Smith.</p>

<p>“I will,” said the rat, “but not now. I
can do things much better at night, and
I prefer being indoors. To-night, when
everybody is in bed and asleep, and the
house is quiet, I will come to your room
and wake you up. We can talk without
being disturbed then, and I will soon teach
you what a clever animal I am.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what you will have to tell
me,” said Tommy Smith. “But say what
you will, I believe that rats were only made
to be killed.”</p>

<p>The rat looked <i>very</i> angry. “They have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
as much right to be alive as little boys
have,” he said. “But good-bye for the
present,” and he scampered away.</p>

<p>Tommy Smith walked on, and when he
had gone some little way, he saw a number
of rooks walking about a field. There was
a haystack in the field, and he thought
that perhaps if he were to get behind it
and wait there for a little while, some of the
rooks would come near enough for him to
throw a stone at them. So he put several
stones in his pocket, and then, with one
in his hand, he began to walk towards
the haystack. When he got there, he sat
down behind it, and peeped cautiously
round the corner. Yes, the rooks were
still there, and some of them were coming
nearer. “Oh,” thought Tommy Smith (but
I think he must have thought it aloud), “I
have only to wait a little while, and then,
perhaps, I shall be able to kill one.”</p>

<p>“For shame!” said a voice close to him.</p>

<p>Tommy Smith looked all about, but he
saw no one. “Who was that?” he said.</p>

<p>“Oh, fie!” said the voice. “What? kill
a poor rook? What a wicked, wicked thing
to do!”</p>

<p>Tommy Smith thought that there must
be someone on the other side of the haystack,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
so he went there to see; but he
found no one. Then he walked all round
it, but nobody was there. But the rooks
had seen him as he went round the haystack,
and they all flew away. Then the
same voice (it was rather a hoarse one)
said, “Ah! now they are gone; so you
will not be able to kill any of them.”</p>

<p>“Who are you?” said Tommy Smith.
“I hear you, but I cannot see anybody;”
and, indeed, he began to feel rather
frightened.</p>

<p>“If I show myself, will you promise not
to hurt me?” said the hoarse voice.</p>

<p>“Yes, I will,” said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Very well, then. Throw away that
stone you have in your hand, and the
ones in your pocket as well.”</p>

<p>Tommy Smith did this, and then, what
should he see, standing on the very top
of the haystack, but a large black rook.
“Why, where were you?” he said. “I
did not see you there when I looked.”</p>

<p>“No,” the rook said; “I hid myself
under a little loose hay, for I did not want
a stone thrown at me. I saw you coming,
and I knew very well what you wanted to
do, so I thought I would wait till you came,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
and then give you a good talking to. And,
indeed, a naughty boy like you, who wants
to kill rooks, <i>ought</i> to be scolded.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why it is so naughty,” answered
Tommy Smith; “I have always
thrown stones at the rooks, and nobody
has ever told me not to.”</p>

<p>“That is just why <i>I</i> have come to tell
you how wrong it is,” said the rook.
“Would you like anybody to throw stones
at you?”</p>

<p>Tommy Smith had to confess that he
would not like <i>that</i> at all.</p>

<p>“Then, do you not know,” the rook went
on, looking very grave, “that you ought to
do the same to other people that you would
like other people to do to you? Have not
your father and mother taught you that?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, they have,” said Tommy
Smith; “but I don’t think they meant
animals.”</p>

<p>“They ought to have meant them,” said
the rook, “whether they did or not, for
animals have feelings as well as human
beings. If you are kind to them, they are
happy; but if you are unkind to them and
hurt them, then they are unhappy. An
animal, you know, is a living being like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
yourself, and surely it is better to make
any living being happy than to make it
unhappy.”</p>

<p>Tommy Smith looked rather ashamed
when he heard this, and did not quite
know what to say. He thought the rook
spoke as if he were preaching a sermon,
and then he remembered having heard
some old country people talk of “Parson
Rook.” Still, what he <i>said</i> seemed to be
sensible, and all <i>he</i> could say, at last, as an
answer was, “Oh, it’s all very well, but you
know you rooks do a great deal of harm.”</p>

<p>“That shows how little you know about
us,” answered the rook. “We do not do
harm, but good; and if the farmers knew
how much good we did them, they would
think us their best friends.”</p>

<p>“Why, what good <i>do</i> you do them?”
said Tommy Smith. “I always thought
that you ate their corn.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps we may eat a little of it,” the
rook said; “that is only fair, for if it were
not for us, the farmer would have very little
corn or anything else. I am sure, at least,
that he would have scarcely any potatoes.”</p>

<p>“Oh! but why wouldn’t he?” said
Tommy Smith.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>“I will explain it to you,” said the rook.
“So now listen, because you are going to
learn something. There is an insect which
you must often have seen, for it is very
common in the springtime. It is about
the size of a very large humble-bee, and it
has wings too, but you would not think it
had at first, for they are hidden under a
pair of smooth, brown covers, which are
called shards. In the daytime it sits upon
a tree or a bush, or sometimes you may
see it crawling along a dusty road. But
in the evening it begins to fly about with a
humming noise. This insect is called the
cockchafer. The mother cockchafer lays
her eggs in the ground, and, after a few
weeks, there comes out of each egg something
which you would not think was a
cockchafer at all, because it is so different.
It has a yellow head and a long white
body, which is bent at the end in the shape
of a hook. On the front part of its body
it has three pairs of legs, like a caterpillar’s,
only they are very small; but behind, it
has no legs at all. It has a very strong
pair of jaws, and with these it cuts through
the roots of the grass and corn and wheat
under which it lies, for these are the things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
on which it feeds. There is hardly anything
which the farmer plants, and would
like to see grow, that this grub or caterpillar
(for that is what it is) does not eat
and destroy; but what it likes best of all
is the potato.</p>

<p>“The cockchafer-grub lies in the ground
for four years before it turns into a real
cockchafer, and all this time it keeps growing
larger and larger; and, of course, the
larger it grows, the more it eats and the
more harm it does. Now if there were no
one to kill this great, greedy thing, I don’t
know what the farmers would do, for all
their crops would be spoilt. But we rooks
kill them, and eat them too, for they are
very nice, and we like them very much.
We eat them for breakfast, and dinner, and
supper, so you can think what a lot of
them we eat in the day. When you see
us walking about over the fields, we are
looking for these great white things, and,
whenever we give a dig into the ground
with our beaks, you may be almost sure
that we have either found one of them or
something else which does harm too.
When the fields are ploughed, a great
many grubs and worms are turned up by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the ploughshare, and then you may see us
following the plough, and walking along in
the furrow it has made, so as to pick up all
we can get. So think what a lot of good
we must do, and remember that the boy
who kills a rook is doing harm to somebody’s
corn, or wheat, or potatoes.”</p>

<p>“I do not want to do that,” said Tommy
Smith.</p>

<p>“Of course not,” said the rook; “so you
must not throw stones at us any more.”</p>

<p>“I won’t, then,” said Tommy Smith.
“But why do the farmers shoot you, if you
do them so much good?”</p>

<p>“You may well ask,” the rook answered.
“They ought to be ashamed of themselves.
I will tell you something about
that. Once upon a time some farmers
thought they would kill us all because we
stole their corn; so they all went out
together with their guns, and whenever
they saw any of us, they fired at us and
killed us, until, at last, there was not a rook
left in the whole country; for all those that
had not been shot had flown away. The
farmers were so glad, for they thought that
next year they would have a much better
harvest. But they were quite wrong, for,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
instead of having a better harvest, they
had hardly any harvest at all. The slugs
and the caterpillars, and, above all, the
great, hungry cockchafer-grubs, had eaten
almost everything up; for, you see, there
were no hungry rooks to eat <i>them</i>. The
little corn we used to take from the farmers
they could very well have spared, but now,
without us, they found that they had lost
much more than they could spare. Then
the farmers saw how foolish they had been,
and they were very sorry, and did all they
could to get the rooks to come back again;
and when they did come back, they took
care not to shoot them any more.”</p>

<p>Tommy Smith was very interested in
this story which the rook told him, and he
was just going to ask where it all happened,
and whether it was near where he lived or
a long way away, when the rook said,
“Well, I must be flapping” (just as an old
gentleman might say, “Well, I must be
jogging”); “there is a meeting this afternoon
which I ought to attend.”</p>

<p>“A meeting!” Tommy Smith said, feeling
quite surprised.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” replied the rook. “Why
not? I belong to a civilised community,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
so, of course, there are meetings. I should
be sorry not to go to <i>some</i> of them.”</p>

<p>It seemed very funny to Tommy Smith
that birds should have meetings as well as
men. “But, perhaps,” he thought, “it is
not quite the same kind of thing.” Only
he didn’t like to <i>say</i> this, in case the rook
should be offended, so he only asked,
“What sort of a meeting is it that you
are going to, Mr. Rook?”</p>

<p>“A very important one,” the rook answered.
“It is a meeting to try someone
who is accused of having done something
wrong.”</p>

<p>“Why, then, it is a trial,” said Tommy
Smith. “But do rooks have trials?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said the rook. “Have I
not just said that we are a civilised community?
We are not <i>wild</i> birds. Amongst
civilised people, when someone is accused
of doing wrong, he is tried for it, is he
not?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes!” said Tommy Smith. “If he
is a man, he is.”</p>

<p>“If he is a man, men try him,” said the
rook; “but if he is a rook, rooks do.”</p>

<p>“But what do you do if you find him
guilty?” said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, we punish him, to be sure,” said
the rook; “and if he has been <i>very</i> wicked,
we peck him to death.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but that is very cruel,” said
Tommy Smith. He forgot that he had
seen <i>innocent</i> rooks <i>shot</i> without thinking
it cruel at all.</p>

<p>“Not more cruel than hanging a man,”
the rook answered. “Do you think it
is?” and Tommy Smith couldn’t say
that he did. He thought he would very
much like to see this trial that the rook
was going to. “Oh, Mr. Rook,” he said,
“do let me go with you.” But the rook
said, “Oh no! that would never do.
No men are allowed at our trials. There
are no rooks at yours, you know.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Tommy Smith; “but that
is because”&mdash;</p>

<p>“Never mind why it is,” interrupted
the rook; “no doubt there is some good
reason, and we have our reasons too.
We could not try a rook properly if
we thought a man was watching us. It
would make us nervous. Sometimes
(but not very often) a man has watched
us without our knowing it, and then he
has told everybody about our wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
trials. But people have not believed him;
and other men, who sit at home and see
very little, and only believe what they
see, have written to say it was all nonsense.
But now, when they tell <i>you</i> it
is all nonsense, <i>you</i> will not believe <i>them</i>,
because a rook himself has told you it
is all true.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, and I believe it,” said Tommy
Smith. “But do tell me what the rook
you are going to try has done.”</p>

<p>“I cannot tell you that till we have
tried him,” said the rook, “for perhaps it
may not be true after all. As yet, I do
not even know what he is accused of.
Perhaps it is of stealing the sticks from
another rook’s nest to make his own
with. Perhaps it is of something even
worse than that. But this you may be
sure of, that if we <i>do</i> peck him to death,
it will be because he has behaved himself
in a manner totally unworthy of a
rook. Now I really must go, or I shall
be late. Good-bye,&mdash;and, let me see, I
think you promised never to throw stones
at rooks again.”</p>

<p>“Oh no!” said Tommy Smith, “I
promise not to.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>“Or to shoot us when you grow up,”
said the rook, just turning his head round
as he was preparing to fly.</p>

<p>“Oh no! indeed, I won’t,” said Tommy
Smith; and the rook flew away with a
loud caw of pleasure.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="small">THE RAT</span></h2>

<p class="pp6q">“<i>The rat is a king. Tommy Smith has a peep<br />
At his palace: but is he awake or asleep?</i>”</p>

<p class="drop-cap00">“I SEE you,” said the rat, as Tommy
Smith passed through the yard of
his father’s house. “I see you, but it is not
the right time yet. Wait till to-night.”</p>

<p>So all that day Tommy Smith kept
thinking of what the rat had promised;
and when his bedtime came, instead of
wanting to stay up longer, as he usually
did, he was quite pleased to go, and
went upstairs without making any fuss.
“Now,” thought he, as he made himself
nice and snug in bed, “I shall keep
awake till the rat comes. I am not at
all sleepy. I can see the branch of the
cedar tree by the window shaking in the
wind, and I can hear the clock ticking
on the staircase. ‘Tick, tick&mdash;tick, tick,’&mdash;I
wonder if it gets tired of saying that
all day long, and all night long, too, without
ever once stopping,&mdash;unless they don’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
wind it up. ‘Tick, tick&mdash;tick, tick.’ If
I keep on counting it, I shan’t go to sleep.
‘Tick, tick&mdash;tick, tick&mdash;tick, tick&mdash;tick&mdash;squeak!’”</p>

<p>“What was that?” said Tommy Smith,
as he sat up in bed. “That wasn’t the
clock;” and then, all at once, the old
clock on the stairs struck one. “One?
Then it must be wrong. When I got
into bed it was only”&mdash;</p>

<p>“It is quite right,” said a squeaky
little voice close to Tommy Smith’s ear,
“I don’t know what time it was when
you got into bed, but you have been
asleep for a good many hours; and now
it is one in the morning, which is what
<i>I</i> call a nice, comfortable time.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you are the rat,” said
Tommy Smith, rubbing his eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am,” the same voice answered.
“But it is too dark for you to see me here.
Get up, and put on some of your clothes,
and then we will come down to the
kitchen. The fire is not quite out, and
you can put a few more sticks on it.
Then you will be able to see me as
well as I can see you now, and we can
talk together comfortably.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-041.jpg" width="400" height="526" id="i41"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">PAT, PAT, PAT. “DO YOU HEAR?”</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>“But can you see in the dark?” said
Tommy Smith, whilst he sat on the bed
and began to put on his stockings.</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” the rat answered; “just
as well as I can in the light.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could,” said Tommy Smith,
“for I can’t see <i>you</i> at all.”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” said the rat. “So,
you see, it has not taken a <i>very</i> long
time to find out something which I can
do, but you can’t. Well, you are ready
now, so come along. You will be able
to follow me, for I will pat the floor just
in front of you with my tail,&mdash;and that is
another thing which you couldn’t do,
even if you were to try for a very long
time.”</p>

<p>“Because <i>I</i> haven’t got a tail,” said
Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“That is one reason,” the rat answered;
“but you can’t be sure you could do it
even if you had one. It might be too
short, you know. Now, come along.”
Pat, pat, pat. “Do you hear?”</p>

<p>Tommy Smith heard quite plainly, and
he followed the rat through the door, and
down the stairs, and right into the kitchen.
The fire was still alight, as the rat had said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
There were some sticks lying in the fender,
and Tommy Smith put some of them on
to make it burn up. Then there was a
blaze of light, and he could see the rat
sitting up on his hind legs, and holding his
front paws close to the bars so as to warm
them.</p>

<p>“Now,” the rat said, “we will begin at
once. I promised to show you that I
could do some clever things as well as the
frog and toad. Do you see that bottle of
oil standing there on the dresser?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, I see it,” said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Well,” the rat went on, “I should like
to taste a little of it. But how do you
suppose I am to get at it?”</p>

<p>“Why, by knocking it over,” said
Tommy Smith at once. “That is the
only way that I can see.”</p>

<p>“Fie!” said the rat. “That may be <i>your</i>
way of drinking oil, but <i>I</i> should be
ashamed to make such a mess. <i>I</i> am a
rat, and I like to do things in a proper
manner.”</p>

<p>Tommy Smith felt a little offended at
this, and he said, “I never knock a bottle
over when I want to get oil or anything
else out of it, for <i>I</i> am a little boy, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
have a pair of hands to lift it up with, and
pour what is in it out of it. But you have
no hands, and you cannot get your head
into it, because the neck is too narrow, and
your tongue is not long enough to reach
down to where the oil is. So I don’t see
what you can do, unless you knock it
over.”</p>

<p>“Fie!” said the rat again. “Well, you
shall soon see what I can do.” And
almost as he said this, he was on the
dresser, and from there he gave a little
jump on to the window-sill, and sat down,
with his long tail hanging over the edge of
it. Now the neck of the bottle came
almost up to the edge of the window-sill,
and the rat’s tail was as long as the bottle.</p>

<p>“Oh, I see!” cried Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“You will in a minute,” said the rat, and
he drew up his tail, and began to feel about
with the tip of it till he had got it right
inside the mouth of the bottle. Then he
let it down again until it was dipped more
than an inch deep into the oil at the
bottom&mdash;for the bottle was not quite half
full.</p>

<p>“Oh, how clever!” cried Tommy Smith,
clapping his hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>“I should think so,” said the rat, as he
drew out his tail, and then, putting the end
of it to his mouth, he began to lick off the
delicious oil. “You say that I have not a
pair of hands,” he went on. “That is true,
but you see I have a tail, and I make it do
just as well.”</p>

<p>“So you do,” said Tommy Smith; “and
I see that you are a very clever animal
indeed.”</p>

<p>“We are clever in many other ways
besides that,” said the rat. “Oil, you
know, is not the only thing which we care
about. We like eggs for breakfast, just as
much as you do, and when we find any, we
take them to our holes, even if they are a
long way off. Now, how do you think we
do that?”</p>

<p>“Let me see,” said Tommy Smith.
“You have no hands, and I don’t think
you could carry an egg in your tail. I
think you must push it in front of you
with your nose and paws.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we can do that, of course,” said the
rat, “but it takes so long, and, besides, the
eggs might get broken. We have better
ways than that. Sometimes, if there are a
great many of us, we all sit in a row, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
pass the eggs along from one to the other
in our fore-paws. But we have another
way which is cleverer still, and as there is
a basket of eggs in that cupboard there, I
don’t mind showing it you; for, between
ourselves, when we do <i>that</i> trick, we like to
have a little boy in the kitchen at nights
to look at us. But, first, I must call a
friend of mine.” The rat then gave rather
a loud squeak, and out another rat came
running; but Tommy Smith didn’t see
where it came from.</p>

<p>“What is it?” said the second rat.</p>

<p>“Oh, I want to show little Tommy
Smith how we carry eggs about,” said the
first rat.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the second rat.
“Come along.” And they both scampered
into the cupboard together. (The door of
the cupboard was half open. <i>I</i> think it
ought to have been shut.)</p>

<p>Very soon the two rats came out again,
but whatever do you think they were
doing? Why, one of them was on his
back, and the other one was dragging him
along the floor by his tail, which he had in
his mouth. But what was that white thing
which the rat who was being dragged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
along was holding? Was it an egg? Yes,
indeed it was; and he was holding it very
tightly with all his four feet, so that it was
pressed up against his body, and didn’t slip
at all.</p>

<p>Tommy Smith could hardly believe his
eyes. “Is that how you do it?” he cried.
“I see. One rat holds the egg, and the
other pulls him along by the tail.”</p>

<p>“Of course he does,” said the rat. “He
pulls him and the egg too.”</p>

<p>“<i>Well</i>,” Tommy Smith said, “of all the
clever things I have <i>ever</i> seen, I think that
is the cleverest. But where are you going
with it?”</p>

<p>Yes, it was easy to ask, but there was no
one to answer him; for both the little rats
were gone all of a sudden,&mdash;and, what is
more, the egg was gone too. “That will
be one egg less for breakfast,” thought
Tommy Smith to himself. “I wonder
that I didn’t think of that before. Ah,
Mr. Rat,” he called out, “you may be very
clever, but you are a thief, for all that.
That egg which you have just taken away
belongs to me. I mean it belongs to my
father and mother. I call that stealing.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do you?” said the rat, for he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
come out of his hole again. “Then just
let me ask you one question. Who laid
that egg?”</p>

<p>“Why, the hen did, of course,” answered
Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Oh, did she?” said the rat. “Then I
suppose your father, or someone else, took
it away from her, and <i>I</i> call <i>that</i> stealing.”</p>

<p>“Oh no,” said Tommy Smith; “I don’t
think it is.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you?” said the rat. “Well, you
had better ask the hen what <i>she</i> thinks. I
feel sure she would agree with me.”</p>

<p>Tommy Smith felt certain that the rat
was wrong, and that the egg had not been
stolen. Still, he thought he had better not
ask the hen; and, whilst he was considering
what he should say, the rat went on with&mdash;“There
are other things we rats do which
are quite as clever as what you have just
seen. But, perhaps, if I were to show
them you, you would make some other
rude remark about stealing.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I should,” Tommy Smith
answered; “and, besides, I feel very sleepy,
and should like to go upstairs to bed
again.”</p>

<p>As he said this, he yawned, and looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
straight into the fire; but, dear me, what
<i>was</i> happening there? The coals in it
seemed to be getting larger and larger,
till they looked like the sides of great red
mountains, and the spaces between them
were like great caves, so deep that Tommy
Smith could not see to the bottom of them.
In and out of these caves, and all down
the sides of the red mountains, hundreds
of rats were running, and they all met each
other in the centre of&mdash;what? Not of the
fireplace. Of course not, for they would
have been burnt. Nor of the kitchen
either. There was no kitchen now. It
had all disappeared. It was in the centre
of a great hall, or amphitheatre, that
Tommy Smith stood now; and when he
looked round him, he saw only those great
rugged mountains, which seemed to make
its walls on every side. He looked up
but he could see nothing. There was
neither sun, nor moon, nor stars, yet
everything was lit up with a strange light,
which seemed to Tommy Smith like the
red glow of the fire, though he couldn’t see
the fire any more. It had gone with the
kitchen.</p>

<p>“Where am I?” he cried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>“In the great underground store-cupboard
of the rats,” said a voice close beside
him; and, looking round, he saw the same
rat who had come up into his bedroom,
and taken him down to the kitchen, and
shown him his clever tricks.</p>

<p>Yes, he was the same rat,&mdash;but how
different he looked! On his head was a
yellow crown, which was either of gold, or
<i>else</i> it must have been cut out of a cheese-paring;
and in his right fore-paw he held
his sceptre, which looked <i>exactly</i> like a
delicate spring-onion. He had a necklace
of the finest peas round his neck, from
which a lovely green bean hung as a
pendant upon his breast, and his tail was
twisted into beautiful <i>rings</i>. “I am the
king of the rats,” he said, “and all the
other rats are my subjects. Those great
caves which you see in the sides of the
mountains are so many passages that lead
into all the kitchens of the world. Through
them we bring all the good things that
we find in the kitchens, and larders, and
pantries, and then we feast on them here
in our own palace; for a rat’s palace is his
store-cupboard. See!” And with this
the rat king struck his sceptre on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
ground, and at once all the rats left off
scampering about, and formed themselves
into a great many long lines, which
stretched from the mouths of all the caves
right into the very middle of that wonderful
place. There they all sat upright, side
by side, waiting to be told what to do.
Then the king of the rats waved his sceptre
three times round his head, and called out,
“Supper.” Immediately all kinds of things
that are good for rats to eat, such as bits
of cheese, scraps of bread or toast, beans,
onions, bacon, potatoes, apples, biscuits,&mdash;everything
of that kind that you can
possibly think of (besides <i>some</i> things that
you <i>can’t</i> possibly think of), began to pour
out from all the great caves, and to fly like
lightning from rat to rat down all the long
lines. One rat seized something in his
fore-paws and passed it on to another, and
that one to the next, so quickly that it
made Tommy Smith quite giddy to look
at it; and he hardly knew what was
happening, till all at once there was an immense
heap of provisions piled up in the
very centre of the floor. Then the king of
the rats climbed up to the top of the heap,
and called out, “Take your places,” and in
a moment all the other rats came scampering
up, and sat in a large circle round the
great heap of provisions. “Begin!” said
the king; and every rat made a leap
forward, and fixed his teeth into the first
piece of bread, or cheese, or toast, or
bacon, that he could get hold of, and there
was <i>such</i> a noise of nibbling, and gnawing,
and scratching, and squeaking. Tommy
Smith was quite frightened, and put his
fingers to his ears.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>“What are you doing that for?” said the
king of the rats. “Didn’t you hear me tell
you to begin?”</p>

<p>“But I don’t want to begin,” said
Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Why not?” said the king; and all the
other rats stopped eating, and said, “Why
not?”</p>

<p>“Because I don’t like eating in the
night,” Tommy Smith answered; “and,
besides, I can’t eat what rats eat.”</p>

<p>At this there was a great commotion,
and the king of the rats cried out,
“Bite him!” in a very loud and shrill
voice.</p>

<p>Oh, how fast little Tommy Smith ran!
“The caves!” he thought. “They lead to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
all the kitchens of the world, so one of
them must lead to ours.” He got to one,
but the rats were close behind him. He
could see their eyes shining in the dark as
he looked back. “Oh dear!” he said; “I
shall be caught. It’s getting narrower and
narrower, and, of course, it must be a rat’s
hole at the other end. Ah, there! I’m
stuck, and I shall be bitten all over.” As
he said this, he kicked and squeezed as hard
as he could, and, to his great surprise, he
found that the sides of the rat-hole were
quite soft&mdash;in fact, they felt very like bedclothes;
and the next moment his head
was on his own pillow, and the old clock
on the staircase struck two.</p>

<p>“Well, good-night,” said a squeaky little
voice, that he seemed to have heard before.
“If you <i>will</i> go to sleep, I can’t help it, but
I think the way in which little boys turn
night into day is quite dreadful.”</p>

<p>The next time Tommy Smith heard the
old clock on the stairs, it was striking
eight, so, of course, it was broad daylight,
and high time to get up. “What a funny
dream I have had,” he said, as he rubbed
his eyes; “or did the rat really come, as
he said he would?” Then, after thinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
a little, he said to himself, “Rats are certainly
very clever animals, and I don’t
think I’ll kill another, even if they do steal
a few things. At anyrate, <i>I</i> won’t hurt
<i>them</i> until <i>they</i> hurt <i>me</i>.”</p>

That you hate everybody who hunts the poor hare.</i>”</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">WHAT a beautiful day it was!</p>

<p>How bright the sun shone, and
how pleasantly the birds were singing,&mdash;for
it was the lovely season of spring.
All the air was full of melody, so that
it seemed to Tommy Smith as if he had
somehow got inside a very large musical
box, which <i>would</i> keep on playing. And
so he had, <i>really</i>, only it was Nature’s great
musical box,&mdash;the music was immortal,
and the works were alive.</p>

<p>Far up in the sky the lark was doing
his very best to please little Tommy
Smith and everybody else, for he made
whoever heard him feel happier than they
had felt before. But what was little
Tommy Smith doing to show how grateful
he was to the bird that gave him so
much pleasure? Why, I am sorry to
say that he was trying to find the poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
lark’s nest, so that he might take away
the eggs which were in it,&mdash;those eggs
which the mother lark had been taking
so much trouble to keep warm, so that
little baby larks might come out of them,
which she meant to feed and take care
of till they were grown up, and could fly
and sing like herself. It was the thought
of those eggs, and of the mother bird
sitting upon them, which made the lark
himself sing so gladly up in the air, for,
when he looked down, he fancied he could
see them; and he knew that there was
someone waiting for him there who would
be glad to see him again, when he came
down to roost. But Tommy Smith did
not think of this, for nobody had talked
to him about it. All he thought of was
how he could get the eggs, so that he
could take them away with him, and show
them to other boys.</p>

<p>Ah! what was that? How gracefully
the cowslips waved, and up went a lark
into the sky; and as he rose he seemed
to shake a song out of his wings. Tommy
Smith thought there was sure to be a nest
close to where he had risen, so he went
to look; but before he had got to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
place, away went something&mdash;something
brown like a lark, but ever so much
larger, and, instead of flying, it galloped
along over the ground; so, you see, it was
not a bird at all. What was it? Tommy
Smith knew well enough, for he had often
seen such an animal before. “Ha!” he
cried. “Puss! puss! A hare! a hare!”
and he sent the stick which he had in
his hand whizzing after it; but, I am glad
to say, he did not hit it.</p>

<p>The hare did not seem so very
frightened. Perhaps he knew that he
could run away faster than any stick
thrown by a little boy could come after
him. At anyrate, before he had gone
far, he stopped, and then he turned round,
and raised himself right up, almost on
his hind legs, and looked back at Tommy
Smith.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, as Tommy Smith came
up; “you see you cannot catch me.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Tommy Smith&mdash;he was
getting quite accustomed to having talks
with animals,&mdash;“you run too quickly.”</p>

<p>“For my part,” said the hare, “I wonder
how any little boy who has a kind heart
can like to tease and frighten a poor, timid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
animal who is persecuted in so many ways
as I am.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by ‘persecuted’?”
said Tommy Smith. “That is a word
which I don’t understand. It is too long
for me.”</p>

<p>“It is a great pity,” the hare went on,
“that a little boy should always be <i>doing</i>
something which he does not know the
word for. To ‘persecute’ people is to be
very cruel to them, and whenever you hurt,
or annoy, or frighten, or ill-treat any of us
animals, then you are persecuting us.”</p>

<p>“If I had known that,” said Tommy
Smith, “I would not have done it.”</p>

<p>“Then you mustn’t do it any more,”
said the hare; “and especially not to me,
because I have so many enemies who are
always trying to injure me.”</p>

<p>“Why, what enemies have you?” said
Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Plenty,” the hare said. “First, there
is that wicked animal the fox, who is
always ready to kill and eat me whenever
he has the chance. He is very
cunning, and, as he knows he cannot run
fast enough to catch me, he tries all sorts
of ways to pounce upon me when I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
not expecting it. Sometimes he will wait
by a hole in the hedge that he has seen
me go through, and when I come to it
again, he springs out and seizes me with
his teeth and kills me, for he is much
stronger than I am. Then sometimes
one fox will chase me past a place where
another fox is hiding, and then the fox
that was hiding jumps out at me, and they
both eat me together.”</p>

<p>“How wicked!” said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Is it not?” said the hare. “And then
there is that horrid little creature the
weasel. He follows me about till he
catches me, and then he bites me in the
throat, so that I bleed to death.”</p>

<p>“That <i>is</i> horrid of him,” said Tommy
Smith. “But there is one thing which I
cannot understand. The weasel does not
go so very fast, and you can run faster
than a horse. I am sure that if you were
to run away, he would never be able to
catch you.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know what it is,” said the
hare. “That odious little animal follows
me about, and never leaves off. You see,
wherever I go I leave a smell behind me.”</p>

<p>“Do you?” said Tommy Smith. “That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
seems very funny. Why, I am close to
you, and I don’t smell anything.”</p>

<p>“Little boys cannot smell nearly as well
as animals,” said the hare. “However, I
don’t <i>quite</i> understand it myself, for I am
sure I am as clean as any animal can be,
and there is nothing nasty about me;
and yet whenever my feet touch the
ground, they leave a smell upon it. That
is my <i>scent</i>; but other animals have
their scent too as well as I, so I needn’t
mind about it. Now the weasel has a
very good nose, so that he is able to
follow the scent that I have left on the
ground, until he comes to where I am;
and, besides, when I know that that cruel
little animal is following me, I get so
frightened that I cannot run away, as I
would from you, or from a fox, or a dog.
And so he comes up and kills me.”</p>

<p>“Poor hare!” said Tommy Smith. “I
feel very sorry for you. I am afraid that
you are not clever like other animals, or
else you would escape and get away more
often. The rat would run down a hole,
I am sure, and so would the rabbit. I
have often seen him do it.”</p>

<p>“Pray do not compare me to the rabbit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>”
said the hare. “I have twice as much
sense as he has, and I can tell you that
you make a great mistake if you think I
am not clever, for I am very clever indeed,
as I will soon show you. If you will
follow me a few steps, I will take you
to the place where I was lying when
you frightened me out of it. See, here
it is. Look how nicely the grass is
pressed downward and bent back on
each side, so that it makes a pretty
little bower for me to rest in when I
am tired of running about. That is
better, I think, than a mere hole in the
ground; and, for my part, I look upon
burrowing as a very foolish habit. <i>I</i>
prefer fresh air, and I think that it is
much nicer to see all about one than to
live in the dark. This little bower of
mine is what people call my <i>form</i>, and
I am so fond of it that, however often
I am driven away, I always come back
to it again. And now, how do you
think I get into this form of mine? I
have told you that wherever I go I leave
a scent upon the ground, so if I just
came to my form and walked into it,
any animal that crossed my scent would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
be able to follow it till he came to where
I was. Now, what do you think I do
to prevent this?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Tommy Smith,
after he had thought a little; “I don’t see
how you can prevent it, for you must come
to your form on your feet,&mdash;you cannot
fly.”</p>

<p>“No,” said the hare; “but I can jump.
Look!” And he gave several leaps into
the air, which made Tommy Smith clap
his hands and call out, “Bravo! how well
you do it!”</p>

<p>“Now,” said the hare, “when I am
coming back to my form, I leap first to
this side and then to that side, and then I
make a very big jump indeed, and down I
come in my own house. Of course, by
doing this, I make it much more difficult
for a fox or a weasel to smell where I have
been, for it is only where my feet touch
the ground that I leave my scent upon it.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I see,” cried Tommy Smith; “so,
when you make long jumps, your feet will
not touch the ground at so many places as
they would if you only just ran along it.”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” said the hare.</p>

<p>“And then there will not be so many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
places for a dog or a fox to smell where
you have been,” said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Not nearly so many,” said the hare;
“that is the reason why I do it. I hope
you think <i>that</i> quite as clever as just
running down a hole, which is what the
rat and the rabbit do.”</p>

<p>“I think it very clever, indeed,” said
Tommy Smith; “and I see now that you
are a clever animal.”</p>

<p>“I have other ways of escaping when I
am chased,” the hare went on; “and I think,
when you have heard them, you will confess
they are quite as clever as anything which
that conceited animal, the rat, has shown
you. As to the rabbit, I say nothing. He
is a relation of mine, and we have always
been friendly. But the brains are not on
<i>his</i> side of the family.”</p>

<p>“Please go on, Mr. Hare,” said Tommy
Smith. “I should like to hear all you can
tell me.”</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well,” the hare said, “I have told you
about the fox and the weasel, but they are
not my only enemies. I have others&mdash;horses
and dogs, and, worst of all, hard-hearted
men and women, who ride the
horses, and teach the dogs to run after me,
and to catch me. It is a pretty sight to
see them all meet together in some field or
lane. First one rides up, and then another,
until there are quite a number. They laugh
and talk whilst they wait for the huntsman
to come with his pack of hounds. All are
merry and light-hearted; even the horses
neigh, they are in such spirits. Does it not
seem funny that one creature’s wretchedness
should make so many creatures happy?
And there are women&mdash;ladies, some of them
quite young, and <i>so</i> pretty&mdash;like angels. I
have seen them smile as if they could not
hurt any living thing. You would have
thought that they had come to stroke me,
instead of to hunt me to death. But I
know better. They are not to be trusted.
They have soft cheeks, and soft eyes, and
soft looks, but their hearts are hard.</p>

<p>“At last, up comes the huntsman, in his
green coat and black velvet cap. He
cracks his whip, and the dogs leap and
bark around him&mdash;<i>such</i> a noise! I hear it
all as I lie crouched in my form, and my
heart beats with terror. But I cannot lie
there long, for now they are coming towards
me. I start up, and run for my life.
Away I go, one poor, timid animal, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
never hurt anyone, and after me come men
and women, boys and girls, horses and
dogs, all happy, and all thinking it the
finest thing in the world to hunt and to
kill&mdash;a hare.”</p>

<p>“Are the dogs greyhounds?” said Tommy
Smith.</p>

<p>“No,” answered the hare; “the dogs I
am talking about now are not greyhounds,
but beagles. They hunt me by scent, but
the greyhound hunts me by sight, for he
runs so fast that he can always see me.”</p>

<p>“Does he run as fast as you do?” asked
Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” said the hare; “he runs
much faster, but he does not always catch
me, for all that. When he is close behind
me, I stop all of a sudden, and crouch flat
on the ground. The greyhound cannot stop
himself so quickly, for he is not so clever
as I am. He runs right over me, and it is
several seconds before he can turn round
again. But <i>I</i> turn round as soon as he
has passed me, and then I run as fast as I
can the other way, so that, when he starts
after me again, he is a good way behind.
When he catches up to me, I do the same
thing again. This clever trick of mine is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
called <i>doubling</i>, and I <span class="smcap">am</span> so proud of it,
for if it was not for that, the greyhound
would catch me directly.”</p>

<p>“Then does he never catch you?” said
Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“He never has yet,” said the hare.
“But I have other ways of getting away
from him, as well as from other dogs, and
I will tell you some of them. Sometimes
I run under a gate. The dogs are too big
to do this, so they are obliged to jump
over it. Then, when they are near me, on
the other side I double, in the way I told
you, run as fast as I can back to the gate,
and go under it again. Of course they have
to jump over it a second time, and in this
way I keep running under the gate and
making them jump over it until they are
quite tired, for, of course, it is more tiring
to jump over anything than only to run
under it. At last, when they are too tired
to run any more, I slip quietly through a
hedge and gallop away.”</p>

<p>“Bravo!” cried Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>The hare looked very pleased, and said,
“I see that you are not at all a stupid boy,
so I will tell you something else. Now,
supposing you were being chased across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
the fields by a lot of dogs, and you were
to come to a flock of sheep, what would
you do?”</p>

<p>Tommy Smith thought a little, and
then he said, “I think I should call out
to the shepherd and ask him to help
me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I daresay he <i>would</i> help <i>you</i>,”
said the hare, “for he would remember the
time when <i>he</i> was a little boy, and he would
feel sorry for you. But he would not feel
sorry for <i>me</i>, who am only a little hare (he
was never <i>that</i>, you know). He would
throw his stick at me, as you did, and then
he would do all he could to help the dogs to
catch me. No, it is not the shepherd that
I should ask to help me, but the sheep&mdash;<i>they</i>
are so gentle,&mdash;and when I came to
them I should run right into the middle of
them, and then the dogs would not be able
to find me.”</p>

<p>“But would not the dogs follow you in
amongst the sheep and catch you there?”
said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“No,” said the hare, “they would not
be able to; for the flock would keep
together, so that the dogs could only run
round the outside of it. But <i>I</i> should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
keep right in the middle, and wherever the
sheep went, I should go with them; <i>I</i>
could run between their feet, you know.
Besides, the dogs would not be able to see
me amongst so many sheep.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Tommy Smith. “But could
not they still follow you by your scent?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed, they could not,” said the
hare; “for, you see, sheep have a stronger
scent than I have, and they would put
down their feet just in the very place
where I had put down mine, and then
their scent would hide mine. So, you see,
by hiding amongst a flock of sheep I
should save my life, for the dogs would
not be able either to see me, or smell me,
or to follow me, even if they could.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever done it?” said Tommy
Smith.</p>

<p>“Oh yes!” said the hare; “and there is
something else which I have done. Sometimes
when the dogs were chasing me, I
have run to where I knew another hare
was sitting, and I have pushed that hare
out of his place, so that the dogs have
followed <i>him</i> instead of <i>me</i>. <i>I</i> sat down
where <i>he</i> had been sitting, and they all
went by without finding it out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well,” said Tommy Smith, “that may
have been very clever, but I don’t think it
was at all kind to the other hare.”</p>

<p>The hare looked a little surprised at
this, as if he had not thought of it before.
“One hare should help another, you
know,” he said; “and, besides, I daresay
the dogs did not catch him after all. <i>He</i>
may have found <i>another</i> hare.”</p>

<p>Tommy Smith was just beginning with
“Oh, but”&mdash;when the hare said, “Never
mind!” rather impatiently, and then he
continued, “And now I am going to tell
you something which will show you that,
although I am not a large or a fierce
animal, I can sometimes be revenged on
those who injure me, though they are
larger and fiercer than myself.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do tell me,” said Tommy Smith,
for the hare had paused a little, and
seemed to be thinking.</p>

<p>“Ah!” he began again; “how well I
remember it. I was very nearly caught
that time. How fast the greyhounds ran,
and how close behind me they were!
What could I do to get away? I had
gone up steep hills to tire them; and I
<i>had</i> tired them, but then I had tired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
myself still more. I had run up one side
of a hedge and down the other, so that
they should not see me, and then I had
gone through the roughest and thorniest
part of that hedge, in hopes that they
would not be able to follow. But they
had kept close after me all the time, and
now they were just at my heels. Then I
doubled. Oh, how close I lay on the
ground as the greyhounds leaped over me!
I saw their white teeth, and their glaring
eyes, and their red tongues lolling out of
their great open mouths. But they had
missed me, and I was saved for a little
while. But where was I to run to next?
There were no hedges now; no woods, or
hills, or rocky ground, nothing but smooth
level grass, which is just what greyhounds
love to race over. Was there no escape?
Yes. What was that long line far away
where the green grass ended and the blue
sky began? White birds were wheeling
above it, and, from beneath, came a sound
as though a giant were whispering. That
was the sound of the sea, and the long line
meeting the sky was the line of the cliffs.
Oh, if I could reach it! But, first, I had
to double&mdash;once&mdash;twice&mdash;three times;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
over me they flew, and off I darted again.
And now the line grew nearer, the white
birds looked larger as they sailed in the
air, and the whispering sound was changing
to a moan&mdash;to a roar. Yes, I was
close to it now, but the greyhounds were
just behind me, and their hot breath blew
upon my fur. They had caught me! No.
On the very edge of the cliffs I doubled once
more, and <i>once</i> more they went over me.”</p>

<p>“And over the cliffs?” said Tommy
Smith.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the hare; “over me, and
over the cliffs as well. Something hid the
sky for a moment,&mdash;a dark cloud passed
above me. Then the sky was clear again;
and there were no greyhounds now. Over
and over, down, down, down they went,
and were dashed to pieces on the black
rocks, and drowned in the white waves.
I know they were, for I peeped over the
edge and saw it. You may ask the seagulls,
if you like. They saw it too.”</p>

<p>“Were they all drowned?” said Tommy
Smith.</p>

<p>“Yes, all,” said the hare.</p>

<p>“And were you glad?” he asked, for
it seemed to him very dreadful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well,” the hare said, “I was glad to
escape, of course, and so would you have
been. But yet I could not help feeling
sorry for the poor dogs, because they had
been <i>taught</i> to chase me, and it was not
their fault. Do you know who I should
have liked to see fall over the cliffs instead
of them?”</p>

<p>“Who?” said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“The cruel, hard-hearted men who
taught them,” said the hare. “It is they
who ought to have been drowned, and I
am very sorry that they were not.”</p>

<p>“You poor hare!” said Tommy Smith,
as he stroked its soft fur, and played with
its long, pretty ears. “It is very hard
that you should always be hunted, and I
do think that you are very badly treated.
But what clever ways you have of escaping!
Do you know, I think you are the
cleverest animal I have had a talk with
yet, and I like you very much.”</p>

<p>“Ah! it is all very well to say that
now,” said the hare. “But who was it
that threw a stick at me?”</p>

<p>“I never will again,” said Tommy
Smith. “You know you jumped up all of
a sudden, so that I had no time to think.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
But I did not come out on purpose to
throw it at you. I only wanted to find a
lark’s nest, so as to get the eggs.”</p>

<p>When the hare heard that, I cannot tell
you how sad and grieved he looked.
“What!” he said. “Would you take the
poor lark’s eggs away, and make it unhappy?
No, no; if you really like me, as
you say you do, you must promise me not
to do anything so cruel as that. The lark
is the best friend I have. He sings to me
as I lie in my form, and consoles me for
all my troubles. His voice cheers me too,
when I am being chased by the dogs, for
he always seems to be saying, ‘You will
get away; I know you will get away.’
Then sometimes he comes down to roost
quite close to me, and we talk to each
other. <i>He</i> tells <i>me</i> what it is like up
above the clouds, and <i>I</i> tell <i>him</i> all that
has been going on down here. He has <i>his</i>
trials too, for there are hawks that try to
catch <i>him</i>, just as there are greyhounds
that try to catch <i>me</i>; so we sit and
comfort each other. Promise me never
to be unkind to my friend the lark.”</p>

<p>“I won’t hurt him,” said Tommy Smith.
“And if ever I find his nest with eggs in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
it, I will only just look at them and leave
them there.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you,” the hare said; “and
you won’t hurt me either?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed, I won’t,” said Tommy
Smith. “Do you know, I begin to think
that it would be better not to hurt any
animal.”</p>

<p>“Oh, much better!” said the hare, as
he skipped gladly away. “Except the
fox,&mdash;and the weasel, you may hurt <i>him</i>&mdash;if
you can catch him.” He said that, of
course, because he <i>was</i> a hare, and felt
prejudiced. You must not think <i>I</i> agree
with him. Only a critic or a silly person
would think <i>that</i>.</p>

<span class="small">THE GRASS-SNAKE AND ADDER</span></h2>

<p class="pp6q">“<i>Tommy Smith has a talk with the grass-snake, and then<br />
With the adder: they’re both as conceited as men.</i>”</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">WHEN Tommy Smith had said
good-bye to the hare, he thought
he would walk home through some woods
which were not far off. So off he set
towards them, and as he went along he
said to himself, “I know there are a
great many animals that live in the woods.
Now I wonder which of them will be the
first to have a talk with me. Let me see.
The pigeon and the squirrel both live
there, for I have often seen them together
on the same tree. And then there is the&mdash;”
Good gracious! What was that
just gliding out from under a bush?
Tommy Smith gave a start and a jump,
and well he might, for it was a large
snake, perhaps three feet long. He was
so surprised that, at first, he didn’t quite
know what to do, and before he had made
up his mind, it was too late to do anything,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
for the snake had wriggled away
into another bush. “It was an adder,”
said Tommy Smith out loud. “That,
at least, is an animal which I <i>ought</i> to
kill, because it is poisonous.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” said a sharp,
hissing voice. “I am not an adder, and
I am <i>not</i> poisonous.”</p>

<p>Tommy Smith looked all about, but
he could see nothing. Still, he felt sure
that it must be the snake who had
spoken, because the voice came from the
very centre of the bush into which he
had seen it go. So he answered, “Of
course it is very easy for you to say
that, but everybody knows that snakes
are poisonous, and, if you are not a snake,
I should just like to know what you
are.”</p>

<p>“I did not say that I was not a <i>snake</i>,”
said the voice again. “Of course I am,
but I am not an adder for all that. There
are two different kinds of snakes in this
country. One is the adder, which is
poisonous, and the other is the grass-snake,
which is quite harmless. Now <i>I</i>
am the grass-snake, so if you had killed
me, you would have done something very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
wrong, for you would have killed a poor
harmless animal.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Tommy Smith, “if that
is true, I am glad I didn’t kill you. But
are you quite sure?”</p>

<p>“If you don’t believe <i>me</i>,” said the
snake, “you must get some good book
of natural history, and there you will
find it mentioned that we grass-snakes
are quite harmless. It is the great
superiority which our family have always
had over that of the adder. People may
call <i>him</i> a ‘poisonous reptile,’ but they
cannot speak of <i>us</i> in that way. If they
were to, they would only show their
ignorance.”</p>

<p>“But how am I to know which is one
and which is the other?” asked Tommy
Smith.</p>

<p>“You will not find <i>that</i> very difficult,”
the grass-snake answered; “and if you
will promise not to hurt me, I will come
out from where I am and show you.”</p>

<p>Of course Tommy Smith promised (you
see he was getting a much better boy to
animals than he used to be), and directly
he had, the snake came gliding out from
under the bush, and lay on the ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
just at his feet. “Now”, he said, “to
begin with, I am a good deal longer
than an adder. I should just like to
see the adder that was three feet long,
and <i>I</i> am an inch longer than that. No,
indeed! Whenever you see such a fine,
long snake as I am, you may be sure
that it is a nice grass-snake, and not a
nasty adder.”</p>

<p>“I won’t forget that,” said Tommy
Smith. “But, I suppose, snakes grow
like other animals. How should I be
able to tell you from an adder if I
were to meet you before you were three
feet long?”</p>

<p>“Why, by my skin, to be sure!” said
the grass-snake. “Look how beautifully
it is marked, and what a fine greenish
colour it is. I may well be proud of it,
for a very great poet indeed has called
it ‘enamelled,’ and says that it is fit for
a fairy to wrap herself up in. Think
of <i>that</i>! The adder’s is quite different,
only a dull, dirty brown, which I <i>might</i>
call ugly if I were ill-natured. But I
am <i>not</i>, so I will only say that it is
plain. I don’t think any fairy would
like to wrap herself in <i>his</i> skin.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>“But are there fairies?” said Tommy
Smith.</p>

<p>“There are, as long as you are a little
boy,” said the grass-snake; “but as soon
as you are grown up there will be none.”</p>

<p>“How funny!” said Tommy Smith.
“But do you know, Mr. Grass-Snake, I
should not like to wrap myself up in
your skin, even if I could, because it is
so hard and covered with scales. And
besides, how could the fairies get into
it without killing you first? I don’t
suppose you can change it as the frog
and the toad do.”</p>

<p>“Not change it!” said the grass-snake.
“And why not, pray? I should think
myself a very stupid animal if I could
not do <i>that</i>. Of course I change it, and
then it looks and feels quite different to
what it did when it was on me. You
see, it is only just the outer part which
comes off. That is quite thin, and I
don’t think you would find it <i>very</i> much
harder than the petal of a flower. Some
day, perhaps, you may find it if you look
about in the grass or the bushes; for I
rub myself against the grass or bushes
to get it off.”</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">“THERE ARE THREE FROGS IN MY STOMACH AT THE MOMENT”</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then you do not swallow your skin
as the toad does?” Tommy Smith asked.</p>

<p>“I should not like to do anything so
nasty,” said the grass-snake angrily, “and
I wish you wouldn’t keep talking to me
about frogs and toads. They are very
low animals, and only fit to be eaten.”</p>

<p>Tommy Smith was quite shocked when
he heard this, and he said, “Take care,
Mr. Grass-Snake. Frogs and toads are
very useful animals, and my friends, too.
So I won’t let you eat them.”</p>

<p>“That is talking nonsense,” said the
grass-snake. “You can’t help my eating
them, especially frogs. Why, there are
three frogs in my stomach at this
moment.”</p>

<p>Directly Tommy Smith heard that, he
made a dart at the grass-snake, and caught
hold of him before he could get away. I
don’t know what he meant to do. Perhaps
he meant to kill the poor snake, which
would have been very wrong, as you
will see. But before he had time to
do anything at all, two curious things
happened. One was that the snake
opened his mouth very wide indeed,
and out of it came first one, then another,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
and then a third frog. Yes; three large
frogs came out of the snake’s mouth,
one after the other, and there they all
lay on the grass. That was one funny
thing, and the other was that, as soon
as Tommy Smith caught hold of the
snake, the snake began to smell in a
way that was not at all pleasant. Indeed,
it was such a <i>very</i> nasty smell that Tommy
Smith was glad to drop him, so that he
got away into the bush again.</p>

<p>“Ah, ha!” the snake said, as soon as
he was safe, “I thought you wouldn’t
hold me very long. Just look at your
hand now.”</p>

<p>Tommy Smith looked at his hand. It
had a thick yellowish fluid on it, which
made it feel quite moist, and it was this
fluid which had such a disagreeable smell.
He was very much offended with the
grass-snake, and he called out to him,
“I think that is a very nasty trick to play,
indeed.”</p>

<p>“I thought you wouldn’t like it,” replied
the grass-snake, “and that is just why I
did it. I wanted you to let me go, and,
you see, you very soon had to. I always
do that when anyone catches me; and, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
my part, I think it is a very clever idea of
mine.”</p>

<p>“But how do you do it?” asked Tommy
Smith, whilst he stooped down and wiped
his hand on the grass.</p>

<p>“Why, I hardly know,” said the grass-snake.
“It comes naturally to me. Nobody
can be cleaner or more well-behaved
than I am, as long as I am treated properly.
But when I am attacked, and my
life is in danger, I do the only thing which
I can do to protect myself. It is just as if
you had a bottle of something which smelt
so strongly that when you took out the
cork and sprinkled it about, nobody could
stay in the room. Now I have something
which smells like that, only instead of
keeping it in a bottle, I carry it under my
skin, and when I want to use it, then,
instead of taking out a cork, I just open
my skin, and it comes out in little drops all
over me.”</p>

<p>“Open your skin?” said Tommy Smith.
“Why, how do you do that?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know <i>how</i> I do it,” said the
grass-snake, “but I <i>do</i> do it.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Tommy Smith said, “however
you do it, I think it is a very nasty habit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
And besides, I shouldn’t have caught hold
of you if you hadn’t told me that you had
been eating frogs. I think it is very cruel
of you to eat them. Why do you do it?”</p>

<p>“Why do I do it?” answered the grass-snake.
“Why, because I feel hungry, to
be sure. Why do you eat sheep, and
oxen, and pigs, and ducks, and fowls, and
turkeys?”</p>

<p>“Oh! but everybody eats them,” said
Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Every <i>snake</i> eats frogs,” said the grass-snake.
“We were made to eat them, and
the frogs were made for us to eat. That is
my theory. It is a good one, I feel sure,
for it explains <i>the facts</i> and makes <i>me</i> feel
comfortable.”</p>

<p>“But they are so useful,” said Tommy
Smith; “and they do so much good in
the garden.”</p>

<p>“I don’t eat them all,” said the grass-snake,
“and I don’t often go into gardens.
Frogs and toads may be very useful, but
perhaps if I didn’t eat some of them there
would be too many of them in the world,
and then, instead of being useful, they
would be a nuisance. You see, I don’t eat
them all. I leave just as many as are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
wanted, as long as <i>you</i> don’t kill them.
But if <i>you</i> were to kill them too, then there
would be too few.”</p>

<p>Tommy Smith thought a little, and then
he said, “Are you obliged to eat them?”</p>

<p>“Of course I am,” said the grass-snake,
“just as much as you are obliged to eat
beef and mutton. You would think it very
hard if you were to be killed just for eating
your dinner. Then why should you want
to kill me for eating mine? No, no; take
my advice, and learn this lesson. Never
kill one animal for eating another animal.”</p>

<p>Tommy Smith thought over this for a
little, and it seemed to him to be right.
“After all,” he thought, “the frog and the
toad eat insects, and if no animal might
eat any other animal, then a great many
animals would die of starvation, and that
would be very dreadful.” So he said to the
grass-snake, “Well, Mr. Grass-Snake, I
think you are right, and, if you come out
of your bush, I will not try to catch you
any more.” So the grass-snake came
wriggling out again, and then Tommy
Smith asked him why he had brought the
frogs out of his mouth after he had eaten
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>“It was because you frightened me,”
said the grass-snake. “You see, I wanted
to get away, and, with three frogs inside
me, I felt rather heavy. But as soon as
the frogs were gone I was much lighter,
and could go much quicker. Now don’t
you think it was a <i>very</i> clever idea?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it was a very <i>clean</i> idea,”
said Tommy Smith; “but as you were
frightened, perhaps you couldn’t help it.
But now, Mr. Grass-Snake, are there any
other clever things which you can do,
and which are not quite so nasty? If
there are, I should like to hear about
them.”</p>

<p>“I can lay eggs,” said the grass-snake,
“which is more than the adder can do.”</p>

<p>“But can you really lay them?” said
Tommy Smith; “and do you make a nest
for them, like a bird?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the grass-snake. “A bird
makes a nest for her eggs because she has
to sit on them, and she wants a nice, comfortable
place to sit in. Now I don’t sit
on my eggs, for that is not at all necessary.
I just find a nice, warm, moist place for
them, and when I have laid them there, I
go away and leave them. I have no time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
to sit on them like a bird. I am much too
busy.”</p>

<p>“But how are your eggs ever hatched?”
said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said the grass-snake, “I am so
clever that I know the heat of the place
where they lie will be enough to hatch
them. So when they are once safely laid,
I don’t bother about them any more.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Tommy Smith; “but if you
go away, who is there to look after the
young snakes when they come out of the
egg?”</p>

<p>“They look after themselves,” said the
grass-snake. “Birds are like little boys
and girls. They are great babies, and
want someone to take care of them whilst
they are young. But we snakes are so
clever that as soon as we come into the
world we can take care of ourselves, and
don’t want anyone to help us.”</p>

<p>“I should like to see some of your eggs,”
said Tommy Smith. “What are they like?”</p>

<p>“They are white,” said the grass-snake,
“and they are joined together in a long
string, sometimes as many as sixteen or
even twenty. So you may think how
beautiful they look, like a necklace of very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
large pearls. Only they are not hard like
pearls. Their shell is soft, and not at all
like the shell of a bird’s egg.”</p>

<p>“I <i>should</i> like to see them,” said Tommy
Smith.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the grass-snake, “you must
look about in manure-heaps, and then,
perhaps, you will find some. That is the
sort of place that I like to lay them in.”</p>

<p>Tommy Smith thought that this was
another nasty habit of the grass-snake, but
he didn’t like to say so, because he had
said it twice before; so, after a little while,
he said, “And do you really like being a
snake, Mr. Grass-Snake?” You see he
had to say something, and he didn’t quite
know what to say.</p>

<p>“Like it?” said the grass-snake. “Of
course I do. I should be very sorry to be
anything else. Yes, we snakes have a
happy life. In summer we crawl about
and eat frogs, and in winter we find some
nice place to go to sleep in.”</p>

<p>“Then do you sleep all the winter?”
said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Of course,” said the grass-snake. “What
else is there to do? There are no frogs in
winter, and it is cold and unpleasant. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
best thing is to go to sleep, and that is
what I always do.”</p>

<p>Now whilst Tommy Smith was talking
to the grass-snake he kept looking at the
poor dead frogs that were lying on the
grass, and you can think how surprised he
was when, all at once, one of them moved a
little, and then began to crawl away very
slowly. Then the others moved, and began
to crawl away too. So they were not dead
after all. You see, when a snake eats a
frog (or anything else), he does not chew it,
as we do, but just swallows it whole, and
then sometimes the frog will keep alive for
some time inside the snake’s stomach.
Tommy Smith spoke to the frogs, but
they were too faint to answer. So he took
them up, and washed them in a little ditch
which was close by, and then laid them in
a nice long tuft of grass. When he had
done that, he came back to where he had
left the grass-snake, but he did not find
him there again. “Where are you?” he
called out. “Do you mean me?” said a
voice quite near him. It was a hissing
voice, certainly, and sounded a good deal
like the grass-snake’s. But still it did not
sound quite the same, Tommy Smith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
thought. So he said, “I mean you, if you
are the grass-snake,” in rather a doubtful
tone of voice. “No, indeed,” hissed the
voice again, “I am something better than
a grass-snake. <i>I</i> am an adder.” And as
the adder said this, he came crawling out
from a little clump of furze-bush, where he
had lain hidden.</p>

<p>Tommy Smith saw that what the grass-snake
had said was true, for the adder’s
body was shorter and of a duller colour
than the grass-snake’s. His head, too, was
different. It was flatter, and swelled out
more on each side where it joined the
neck, so that the neck looked smaller in
proportion to the size of the head. Altogether,
Tommy Smith felt sure that the
next time he went out for a walk and saw
a snake, he would be able to tell whether it
was a grass-snake or an adder. “And if it
is an adder,” he said to himself, “why, I
ought to kill it.” And then he said out
loud, “Mr. Adder, you don’t seem at all
afraid of me; but, do you know, I think
I ought to kill you, because you are
poisonous.”</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> think you ought to leave me alone
because I am poisonous,” said the adder.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
“For if you were to try to kill me, I should
have to bite you, and then, perhaps, <i>I</i>
should kill <i>you</i>.”</p>

<p>Tommy Smith did not like this remark
of the adder’s at all. He began to feel
afraid himself, and he would have liked to
have run away. But he thought that if he
did, the adder might attack him when his
back was turned. So he stood quite still,
and only said, “Why aren’t you harmless
like the grass-snake?”</p>

<p>“That is not a very polite question!”
said the adder in reply. “<i>I</i> belong to the
poisonous branch of the family, and I am
proud to belong to it. The grass-snake is
a poor creature, and I pity him. I should
like to see anyone catch <i>me</i> in the same
way that they catch <i>him</i>. I would soon
teach them the difference between us.”</p>

<p>“But you do so much harm,” said
Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“What harm have I ever done <i>you</i>?”
said the adder.</p>

<p>“You have not done me any harm,” said
Tommy Smith, “but that is because I
have never seen you before now.”</p>

<p>“<i>You</i> may never have seen <i>me</i>,” said the
adder, “but <i>I</i> have seen <i>you</i> very often.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Sometimes I have been quite near to
where you were walking, but when I have
heard you coming, I have just crawled out
of the way, and let you go by without
hurting you. Now don’t you think that
was very good of me? I should just like
to know what you have to complain of.”</p>

<p>“You have never hurt me, I know,” said
Tommy Smith. “But think how many
people you do hurt.”</p>

<p>“Do you know anybody that I have
hurt?” asked the adder.</p>

<p>“No,” answered Tommy Smith, “I
don’t know anybody; but I am sure you
must have hurt a great many people,
because you are poisonous.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the adder, “I think you
might walk about a long while asking
people before you found anyone that I had
done any harm to. I never interfere with
people unless they interfere with me, so I
think the best thing they can do is just to
let me alone. It is true that my two front
teeth are poisonous, and that I can kill
some creatures by biting them. But these
creatures are not men or women, but only
mice or small birds or frogs. You know I
have to eat them, so I may just as well kill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
them before I begin. The grass-snake eats
<i>his</i> frogs alive. That is much more cruel
than if he killed them first, as I do.”</p>

<p>“How do you kill them?” said Tommy
Smith. “I suppose you sting them with
your forked tongue, and then they die.”</p>

<p>“Did you not hear me say that I bit
them,” said the adder; “and that I had
two poisonous teeth? My tongue is not
poisonous at all. There is no more harm
in it than there is in yours.”</p>

<p>“Oh! but, Mr. Adder,” cried Tommy
Smith, “do you know I once went to the
Zoological Gardens in London, and I saw
the snakes there, and whenever one of
them put out his tongue, as you do yours,
the people all said, ‘Look at its sting!
Look at its sting!’”</p>

<p>“That is only because they were
ignorant people,” said the adder, “and did
not know any better. No; it is the two
long teeth in my upper jaw that are
poisonous, and, if you will just kneel down,
I will open my mouth so that you can see
them, and then I can explain all about it
to you.”</p>

<p>Tommy Smith didn’t quite like the idea
of kneeling down and putting his face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
close to the mouth of the adder. He had
heard of men who put their heads inside a
lion’s mouth, and he thought that this
would be almost as dangerous. However,
the adder promised not to bite him, and as
he said he never <i>had</i> bitten a little boy in
the whole of his life, and should not think
of doing so without a proper reason, he
thought he might trust him. So he
knelt down and looked. Then the adder
opened his mouth, and, as he did so, two
little white things like fish-bones seemed
to shoot forward into the front part of it.
“Those are my two poison-fangs,” he said.
“When my mouth is shut, they lie back
against my upper jaw, but as soon as I
open it to bite anyone, they shoot forward
so as to be in the right place.” Tommy
Smith looked at the teeth. They were as
sharp as needles and almost as thin, but
they were not straight like common needles,
but curved backwards like crochet-needles.
“What curious teeth!” he said.</p>

<p>“Perhaps they are more curious than
you think,” said the adder; “just look at
the tips of them, and see if you notice
anything.”</p>

<p>Tommy Smith looked as the adder told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
him, and he was surprised to see a tiny
little hole at the tip of each tooth. “Why,
Mr. Adder,” he said, “it seems to me
as if your teeth were hollow and wanted
stopping.”</p>

<p>“They <i>are</i> hollow,” said the adder, “and
I will tell you why. At the root of each
of them I have a little bag which is full of
poison. You cannot see it, of course,
because it is hidden under the flesh of my
upper jaw. But things which cannot be
seen are very often felt. Now, when I bite
an animal, these little bags open, and a
drop or two of poison runs down each
tooth where it is hollow, so that it goes
into the flesh of that animal and mixes
with its blood.”</p>

<p>“And does that kill it?” asked Tommy
Smith.</p>

<p>“Oh yes!” answered the adder;
“because I only bite small animals. It
would not kill a horse, or a cow, or even a
pig, unless it was very young. But it kills
field-mice, and shrew-mice, and things of
that sort.”</p>

<p>“But there is one thing, Mr. Adder,
which I don’t understand,” said Tommy
Smith. “I thought that one had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
swallow poison for it to kill one. But you
say that this poison of yours goes into the
blood.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about poisons
that have to be swallowed,” said the
adder; “I only know about <i>my</i> poison,
and I use that in the way I have told you.
<i>My</i> poison must go into the blood. If
you were only to swallow it, I daresay it
would not hurt you at all.”</p>

<p>“I should not like to try,” Tommy
Smith said. “But are you going?” for
the adder had begun to crawl away.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the adder; “I am going
now, for I have plenty to do. I should
not have wasted my time like this, only I
heard that poor creature, the grass-snake,
talking about himself, so I thought I
would just show you what a much more
important animal I am than he.”</p>

<p>“I think that you are rather conceited,
Mr. Adder,” said Tommy Smith. “The
grass-snake is very clever. He can lay
eggs, and he says that is more than you
can do.”</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> should be ashamed to do such a
thing,” said the adder. “A young grass-snake
<i>requires</i> an egg, but a young adder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
knows how to do without one. <i>We</i> can
crawl as soon as we come into the world.
As for my being conceited, perhaps I am,
just a little. But that is natural. I can
<i>never</i> forget that I have <i>poison</i> flowing in
my veins. Now I will say good-bye, for I
have plenty to do, and must not waste my
time any longer.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Mr. Adder,” Tommy Smith
called after him, for he thought he had
better be friendly with such an animal.
“I hope that you will never bite me.”
But the adder merely gave a contemptuous
hiss, and was gone.</p>

<span class="small">THE PEEWIT</span></h2>

<p class="pbq">“<i>To eat peewit’s eggs to a peewit seems wrong,<br />
So a hen MAY think hen’s eggs to hens should belong.</i>”</p>

<p class="drop-cap06">“PEE-WEE-EET! Pee-wee-eet!”
That is what a bird kept saying
as he flew in circles round Tommy Smith.
Sometimes he flew quite a long way off,
and sometimes he came so near him that
it seemed as if he would settle on his head.
“Pee-wee-eet! Pee-wee-eet!” And what
a pretty bird this was! How his white
breast glanced in the sun, and how the
glossy green feathers of his back shone in
it. He kept turning about in the air as
he flew, so that Tommy Smith could see
every part of him.</p>

<p>In fact, this bird was playing the
strangest antics. Sometimes he would
clap his wings together above his back, at
least Tommy Smith thought he did; and
then he would make such a swishing and
whizzing with them, that really it was
quite a loud noise&mdash;almost like a steam-engine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Then, all at once, he would turn
sideways and make a dive down towards
the ground, and sometimes (this was the
funniest trick of all) he would tumble right
over in the air, as if he had lost his
balance and was really falling. If Tommy
Smith had ever seen a tumbler pigeon it
would have reminded him of one, but he
never had. And all the while this bird
kept on calling out, “Pee-wee-eet! pee-wee-eet!”
as if he wanted Tommy Smith
to speak to him, as, perhaps, he did.</p>

<p>“I know what bird <i>you</i> are,” said
Tommy Smith. “I have often seen you
flying over the fields, but you have never
come so close to me before. I think your
name is”&mdash;</p>

<p>“Pee-wee-eet! pee-wee-eet! That is
my name. They call me the peewit.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Tommy Smith; “because
you say”&mdash;</p>

<p>“Pee-wee-eet! pee-wee-eet!” screamed
the bird. “Yes, that is why. It is
because I say ‘Pee-wee-eet’”; and as the
peewit said this, he made a sweep down
and settled on the ground just in front of
Tommy Smith. So close! Tommy Smith
could almost have touched him with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
hand. He <i>was</i> a handsome bird! <i>Now</i>
he could see that, besides his beautiful
green back and his white breast, he had a
handsome black crest at the back of his
head, that stuck out a long way behind it&mdash;as
if his hair had been brushed up
behind, Tommy Smith thought, only, of
course, it was not hair, but feathers.</p>

<p>The peewit was not at all afraid, but
looked up at Tommy Smith, with his head
on one side, and said, “Yes, that is my
name. A name isn’t sensible if it hasn’t
a meaning. Some people call me the
lapwing, but I don’t know what <i>that</i>
means. I would rather <i>you</i> called me the
peewit. I like that name best. Well,
now you may ask me some questions if
you like.” Tommy Smith would rather
have listened to what the peewit had to
tell him about himself first, and then asked
him some questions afterwards, for, just
then, he didn’t quite know what questions
to ask. But, of course, he had to say
something, or it would have seemed rude,
so he began with, “Please, Mr. Peewit,
will you tell me why you say ‘pee-weet’
so often?”</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t I say it?” said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
peewit. “It is my song, and I think it is
a very good one too.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t call it a song at all,” said
Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“<i>Don’t</i> you?” said the peewit.</p>

<p>“No,” said Tommy Smith. “It is not
at all like what the lark or the nightingale
sings. That is what <i>I</i> call singing.”</p>

<p>“If all birds were to sing as well as each
other,” the peewit said, “perhaps you
would not care to listen to any of them
half so much. <i>Now</i> you say, ‘How
sweetly the lark sings,’ or ‘How beautifully
the nightingale sings,’ because they
sing better than other birds. But if every
bird was as clever at singing as they are,
then to sing well would be such a common
thing, that you would hardly notice it at
all. As it is, you don’t think about the
lark nearly so much as the nightingale,
because you hear him much oftener. So
perhaps, after all, it is better that some
birds should sing more sweetly than other
birds. Don’t you agree with me?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Tommy Smith.
“I should never have thought of that,
myself.”</p>

<p>“There are a number of things that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
little boys would never have thought of,”
said the peewit. “Besides,” he went on,
“however well a bird may sing, all he
<i>means</i> by his singing is that he is very
happy. That is what the lark means
when he sings high up in the blue sky;
and it is what the nightingale means when
he sings all night long by his nest. And
that is what I mean, too, when I sing,
‘Pee-wee-eet! pee-wee-eet!’ So if you
look at it in that way, my song is just
as good as theirs, or any other bird’s.”</p>

<p>Tommy Smith did not think the peewit
was right in this opinion of his, but he
thought that he had better not contradict
him so early in the conversation. So he
only said, “Then, I suppose, you must
always be happy, Mr. Peewit, for you are
always saying ‘Pee-wee-eet’?”</p>

<p>“I am always happy as long as people
don’t shoot me, or take away my eggs,”
said the peewit. “Why should I not be?
It is very pleasant to be alive.”</p>

<p>“And the grass-snake said <i>he</i> was
happy too,” thought Tommy Smith.
“Then, are <i>all</i> animals happy, Mr.
Peewit?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” the peewit answered, “they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
all enjoy their life. That is why it is so
wrong to kill them. For when you kill
an animal, you take some of the happiness
that was in the world out of it, and you
can never put it back there again, however
much you try.”</p>

<p>“I never will kill animals any more,”
said Tommy Smith. “But now, Mr.
Peewit, won’t you tell me something about
yourself? Do <i>you</i> do any clever things
as well as the other animals that I have
spoken to?”</p>

<p>“Why, haven’t you seen the way I
tumble about in the air?” said the peewit.
“And don’t you think that <i>that</i> is very
clever? You couldn’t do it yourself, however
much you were to try.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Tommy Smith, “but then <i>I</i>
have not got wings, you know. Perhaps
if I <i>had</i> got wings, I would be able to
do it as well as you.”</p>

<p>“Do you think so?” said the peewit.
“That is only because you are very conceited.
Why, even the swallow can’t do
it. <i>He</i> is a splendid flier, and goes very
fast. But, though you were to watch him
for a whole day, you would not see him
do such funny things in the air as I do.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
As for the other birds&mdash;well, look at the
cuckoo. What do you think of the way
in which <i>he</i> flies? Why, he just goes
along without doing anything at all. Do
you think <i>he</i> could turn head over heels or
make the noise with his wings that I do?
If he can, then why doesn’t he? I should
just like to know that.”</p>

<p>“Are you playing a game in the air
when you fly like that, Mr. Peewit?” asked
Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the peewit; “that is
just what I am doing. Sometimes I play
it by myself, but I like it better when
there are some other peewits to play it
with me. We do it to amuse ourselves,
and because we are so happy and have
such good spirits. But it is only in the
springtime that we play such games, for
we are happier then than at any other
time of the year. In the autumn and
winter we fly about in great flocks over
the fields and marshes, or come down
upon them and look for worms and slugs
and caterpillars, for those are the things
we eat. We are happy then, too, but
not quite so happy as we are in the springtime,
and you won’t see us playing such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
pranks then, although there are a great
many more of us together. Oh yes! it
is a game, but it is a very useful kind of
game, I can tell you.”</p>

<p>“How is it useful?” asked Tommy
Smith.</p>

<p>“Why, it prevents people from finding
our eggs,” answered the peewit. “I have
told you that we only fly like this in the
spring. Well, that is just the time when
we lay our eggs. Now whilst the mother
peewit is sitting quietly on her eggs, the
father peewit keeps flying and tumbling
about in the air. When you go for a
walk over the fields, you do not notice
the mother peewit on her eggs, for she
sits quite still and never moves. But you
can’t help noticing the father peewit, and
you only think of him. If you happen
to go too near the place where the eggs
are, the father peewit comes quite close
to you, and flies round and round your
head, as I did just now. You think that
is very funny, and so you keep looking
at him up in the air, and never think of
looking on the ground where the eggs are.”</p>

<p>“Are the eggs laid on the ground?” said
Tommy Smith.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>“Of course,” said the peewit. “But
let me go on. When the father peewit
sees you are looking at him, he flies a
little farther away from the eggs, and,
of course, you follow him. Then he flies
a little farther off still, and in this way
he keeps leading you farther and farther
away from the eggs, till he thinks they
are safe, and then off he flies altogether.”</p>

<p>“That is very clever,” said Tommy
Smith. “But supposing you didn’t follow
the father peewit, but kept walking towards
where the eggs were, what would
the mother peewit do?”</p>

<p>“Why, she would fly away before you
got to her,” said the peewit. “And you
would find it very difficult to find the eggs
even then.”</p>

<p>“Then, is it only the father peewit that
tumbles over in the air?” said Tommy
Smith.</p>

<p>“It is he who does it most,” said
the peewit. “He has more time, and
besides it would not be thought right
for a mother peewit to throw herself
about in that way whilst she has a
family to attend to. When the mother
peewit goes up from her eggs, she flies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
quietly away till she is a long way
off. Then she settles somewhere on
the ground, and waits for you to go
away, and when you have gone away, she
comes back to her eggs again.”</p>

<p>“Then I suppose <i>you</i> are a father
peewit?” said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” the peewit answered. “You
have seen how <i>I</i> can tumble. And
besides, look how long my crest is. The
crest of the mother peewit is not nearly
so long.”</p>

<p>“Where is the mother peewit?” asked
Tommy Smith&mdash;for he thought he would
like to see her too.</p>

<p>“She is not far off,” the peewit answered,
“and she is sitting on her eggs.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I should so like to see them,”
cried Tommy Smith. “May I?”</p>

<p>“If I show you them,” said the peewit,
“will you promise not to take them away.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, I promise not to,” said
Tommy Smith. “I will only look at
them&mdash;unless you would be so kind as
to give me one,” he added.</p>

<p>“<i>Give</i> you one!” cried the peewit. “I
would rather give you the bright green
feathers from my back, or the beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
crest that is on my head. Give you one,
indeed! No, no; they are not things to
be given away. But come along. You
have promised that you will not take
them, and I know you will not break
your word.” Then the peewit spread his
wings, and rose into the air again, and
began to fly along in front of Tommy
Smith, who had to run to keep up with
him. “Pee-wee-eet! pee-wee-eet!” he
cried. “Come along. Come along.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but you go so fast!” said Tommy
Smith, panting. “I wish I had wings like
you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t wonder at your wishing <i>that</i>,”
the peewit said. “<i>I</i> should think it
dreadful if I could only walk and run.”
All at once the peewit flew down on to
the ground again. “Here they are,” he
said, as Tommy Smith came up; “and
what do you think? Why, one of them
has hatched already; a day earlier than
I expected.”</p>

<p>“But where are the eggs?” asked
Tommy Smith. “I don’t see them, and
I don’t see any nest either. But what&mdash;Oh!
there is the mother peewit sitting
on the ground,” he cried out suddenly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
And so she was, with her eggs underneath
her. This time she did not fly away, for
the father peewit had told her not to be
uneasy.</p>

<p>“Oh, but there is no nest,” said Tommy
Smith. “She is sitting on the bare
ground.”</p>

<p>“<i>Bare</i>, indeed!” exclaimed the mother
peewit. “There is plenty of sand on the
ground, and what more can one want?
Just look!” and as she spoke she moved
a little to one side, and there, in a slight
hollow, Tommy Smith saw four&mdash;no, three
eggs, and something else, something that
was soft and fluffy, so it could not be
an egg, although it was the same size,
and the same sort of colour, yellowish,
with black spots. Why, could that be
a little baby peewit? Yes, indeed it
was, for it moved a little, and made a
little chirping noise.</p>

<p>“Don’t touch him,” cried the father
peewit. “He is too young for that.”</p>

<p>“And little boys are so rough,” said
the mother peewit.</p>

<p>“But you may look at him,” said the
father peewit.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, do,” said the mother peewit;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
“and tell me what you think of him.
Isn’t he the prettiest little fluffy thing
in the whole world?”</p>

<p>“Until the others are hatched,” said
the father peewit. “Then there will be
three more, you know.”</p>

<p>“To be sure there will,” said the mother
peewit, looking <i>very</i> proud; “and they
will all be as pretty as each other. But
I think this one will be the cleverest,” she
added. “There was a certain something
in the way he chipped the shell, and he
has lain in a thoughtful attitude ever
since he came out.”</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear it,” said the father
peewit. And then they both looked up
at Tommy Smith, as if they expected
him to say something.</p>

<p>But Tommy Smith was too busy to
say anything just then. He had gone
down on his hands and knees, and was
looking at the eggs, for they interested
him more even than the little peewit
that had just been hatched. They were
such funny-shaped eggs, large at one end
and pointed at the other, something like
a small pear, Tommy Smith thought,
and they lay in the little hollow with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
their pointed ends all meeting together
in the middle of it. They were of a
greenish yellow colour, with great black
splotches upon them. Of course they
were much smaller than the eggs that
a hen lays, but still, Tommy Smith
thought, they were large eggs for a peewit
to lay. A peewit is hardly so large
as a pigeon, but these eggs were a good
deal larger than a pigeon’s egg. “Yes,
they are very nice eggs,” he said at last,
as he got up from his hands and knees.
“Are they good to eat?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the father peewit, “they
are”; and as he said this he looked
<i>very</i>, <i>very</i> sad.</p>

<p>“Yes, they <i>are</i> good to eat,” said the
mother peewit, as she nestled down on
her eggs again. “Oh, how I wish they
were not!”</p>

<p>“Why?” said Tommy Smith. (He
was only a little boy, or he would not
have asked such questions.)</p>

<p>“I will tell you why,” said the mother
peewit. “There are bad men who come
and take our eggs <i>because</i> they are so
good to eat, and then they sell them to
greedy wretches, who are still worse than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
themselves. Oh, how wicked men are!
Just fancy! They eat our poor little
children whilst they are still in their
cradles.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the father peewit, “for the
mere pleasure of eating, they will ruin
thousands of families.”</p>

<p>“Is it so <i>very</i> wicked to eat eggs?”
asked Tommy Smith. “I have eaten a
great many myself.”</p>

<p>“What! peewit’s eggs?” cried both the
birds together.</p>

<p>“Oh no,” said Tommy Smith feeling
<i>very</i> uncomfortable. “But I have often
eaten fowl’s eggs.”</p>

<p>“That is different,” said the mother
peewit. “We will say nothing about
that.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” said the father peewit. “We
do not wish to be censorious.”</p>

<p>“What does that mean?” asked Tommy
Smith, for it was a long word, and he
did not remember having heard it
before.</p>

<p>“I mean,” said the father peewit, “that
if people <i>only</i> ate fowl’s eggs, peewit’s
eggs would be let alone, and that would
be a very good thing. Fowls, you know,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
are accustomed to it, but we peewits
have finer feelings.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the mother peewit; “we
are more sensitive than common poultry.”</p>

<p>Tommy Smith couldn’t help remembering
what the rat had said to him
about asking the hen, and he thought
he <i>would</i> ask her some day. But now
he was talking to peewits. “You told
me it was very difficult to find your
eggs,” he said.</p>

<p>“So it is,” said the father peewit; “but
it is not impossible.”</p>

<p>“I wish it were,” said the mother
peewit. “But there are wicked men
who learn how to do it, and then they
can find them quite easily. Oh, what
a wicked world it is!”</p>

<p>Tommy Smith didn’t know what to
say to comfort the poor peewits, until
all at once an idea occurred to him.
“Why do you lay eggs at all?” he said.
“You know, if you didn’t lay them, nobody
could take them away from you.”</p>

<p>“Not lay eggs?” cried the mother peewit.
“Why, it is our duty to lay them.
We have our duties to perform, of course.”</p>

<p>“If we did <i>not</i> lay eggs,” said the father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
peewit (he looked <i>very</i> grave as he spoke),
“there would soon be no more peewits
in the world, and what do you suppose
would happen then?”</p>

<p>Tommy Smith didn’t know, so he said,
“What <i>would</i> happen, Mr. Peewit?”</p>

<p>“It is too dreadful to think about,” the
peewit said. “The very idea of it makes
one shudder. A world without peewits!
Oh dear! a nice sort of world <i>that</i> would
be!”</p>

<p>The mother peewit shook her head.
“It could hardly go on, dear; could it?”
she said.</p>

<p>“It <i>might</i>,” answered the father peewit,
“but there would be very little <i>meaning</i>
in it.”</p>

<p>Tommy Smith certainly thought the
world might go on without peewits, but
he didn’t <i>quite</i> understand the last part
of the sentence. “But it seems to me,”
he said to himself, “that <i>animals</i> think
themselves very important.” “And are
<i>you</i> a useful animal?” he said aloud to
the father peewit,&mdash;for the mother peewit
was busy again with her eggs and
the young one.</p>

<p>“Useful!” exclaimed the peewit. “Why,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
we are sometimes put into gardens to eat
the slugs and the insects there. I suppose
<i>that</i> is being useful.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” said Tommy Smith; “if you
don’t eat the cherries, or the strawberries,
or the asparagus, or”&mdash;</p>

<p>“We are not vegetarians,” said the peewit,
“we prefer an animal diet, and we
only eat things that do harm.”</p>

<p>“But don’t you eat worms?” said Tommy
Smith.</p>

<p>“Of course we do,” said the peewit.</p>

<p>“But I don’t think worms do harm.”</p>

<p>“If they don’t, it is because we eat
them,” the peewit retorted. “If we didn’t
eat them, there would be too many of them,
and then, of course, they would do harm.”</p>

<p>“Well, when I grow up,” said Tommy
Smith, “I will have peewits in my garden
as well as frogs, and&mdash;Oh! but do you
agree with frogs?” he asked, for this was
an important point.</p>

<p>“Young frogs agree very well with <i>us</i>,”
said the peewit. “So it comes to the same
thing, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Tommy Smith.
“Not if the old ones don’t.”</p>

<p>“As for the old ones,” said the peewit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
“we leave them alone. They are too big
to be interfered with. So, you see, that’s
all right too.”</p>

<p>Tommy Smith didn’t feel quite so sure
about this. He couldn’t help thinking that
perhaps the peewits ate the little frogs.
But, just as he was going to ask them
this, he remembered that if he didn’t make
haste home, he would be late for dinner.
Of course, as soon as he began to think
about his own dinner, he forgot all about
the peewit’s, and said good-bye at once.
So off he ran. The mother peewit just
nodded to him as she sat on her eggs, but
the father peewit rose up into the air again,
and flew round him, and swished his wings,
and tumbled about, and cried, “Pee-wee-eet!
pee-wee-eet!” and Tommy Smith felt quite
sure that he meant “Good-bye, good-bye.”</p>

<span class="small">THE MOLE</span></h2>

<p class="pp6q">“<i>If we’re only contented, some cause we shall find<br />
To be thankful: the mole thought it nice to be blind.</i>”</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE next walk that Tommy Smith
took was over some fields where
there were a great many mole-hills. Of
course, Tommy Smith had often seen mole-hills
before, but I am not sure if he had
ever seen a mole; for a mole, as you know,
lives underneath the ground, and does not
often come up to the top of it. So, when
he saw a little black thing scrambling about
in the grass, he cried out, “Oh! whatever
is that?” and ran to it and picked it up.</p>

<p>“You won’t <i>hurt</i> me, I know,” said the
mole (for it was one)&mdash;“and I don’t mind
your <i>looking</i> at me.” You see Tommy
Smith was getting a much better boy to
animals, now that they had told him something
about themselves, and the animals
were beginning to find this out, and were
not so frightened of him as they used
to be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>Tommy Smith looked at the mole, and
stroked it as it lay in his hand, and then
he said, “Why, what a funny little black
thing you are.”</p>

<p>“Little!” said the mole; “I don’t know
what you mean by that. I am much
bigger than the mouse or the shrew-mouse.
You don’t expect me to be as big as the
rat, do you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Tommy Smith,
“but, you know, the rat is not so very big.”</p>

<p>“He is as big as he requires to be, I
suppose,” said the mole, “and so am I.
I have never felt too small in all my life,
and I wonder that you should think me
so. Why, look at those great hills of
earth which I have flung up all over the
fields. I am big enough to have made
those, anyhow, and strong enough too.
And look, how large and high they are.”</p>

<p>“But are they so very high?” said
Tommy Smith. “Why, I step over them
quite easily.”</p>

<p>“Dear me, that seems very wonderful,”
said the mole. “But I advise you not to
do it often, for it must be a great exertion,
and you might hurt yourself. But you
must not think that because <i>you</i> are very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
big, <i>I</i> am very small. That would be very
conceited.”</p>

<p>Tommy Smith saw that he had not said
the right thing, so he tried to think of
something to say that the mole would like
better. “Oh,” he said at last, “what a
very pretty, soft coat you have! I like it
very much, indeed.”</p>

<p>“Yes; feel it,” said the mole. “It is a
very handsome fur; and I can tell you
something about it which is curious.”</p>

<p>“What is that?” said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Why, you may stroke it whichever way
you like,” answered the mole, “without
hurting me. It is not every animal that
has a coat like <i>that</i>. There is the cat,
poor thing! If you stroke her fur one
way, she is very pleased and begins to
purr; but if you stroke it the other way, it
hurts her, and she does not like it at all.
That is because her hair is long and lies all
one way. Now my hair is short, and it
does not lie any way.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you mean that it does not
point either towards your head or your
tail,” said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Yes, that is what I mean,” said the
mole. “Instead of that, it sticks straight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
up, and when you stroke it, it moves
whichever way your hand moves, without
making me feel at all uncomfortable.”</p>

<p>“That is a very nice fur to have,” said
Tommy Smith. “Then, I suppose that
sometimes if you were burrowing, and you
wanted to go backwards for a little way, it
would not hurt you to do so.”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” said the mole. “Now the
poor cat could not do that. She could not
go backwards in a burrow, because it would
rub all her hair up the wrong way.”</p>

<p>“But cats don’t burrow,” said Tommy
Smith.</p>

<p>“Of course not,” said the mole. “They
know that they would not be able to, so
they don’t try. They are poor things.”</p>

<p>Tommy Smith could not see why cats
should be poor things because they didn’t
burrow, but the mole seemed quite sure of
it, and he did not like to contradict him.
“I suppose, Mr. Mole,” he said, “that you
are made for burrowing.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am,” said the mole, “and I can
do it better than any other animal in the
world. You see, I have a pair of spades to
help me, and I dig with both of them at
the same time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>“A pair of spades!” cried Tommy Smith
in surprise. “Why, where are they? I
don’t see them.”</p>

<p>“Where are they?” said the mole;
“why, here they are, to be sure,” and he
stretched out his two little front feet, and
moved them about.</p>

<p>“Ah, now I see what you mean,” said
Tommy Smith, and he bent down his
head and began to look at them more
closely.</p>

<p>The mole might well have called his feet
spades, for they were shaped something
like them, and he used them to dig with,&mdash;which
is what spades are used for. They
were short and broad, with five little toes,
and each toe had a very strong claw at the
end of it. These funny little feet stuck out
on each side of the mole’s body, and they
were so very close to the body that they
looked as if they had been sewn on to it.
There did not seem to be any leg belonging
to them at all. Of course there <i>were</i> legs,
and very strong ones too, but they were so
short, and so hidden under the skin, that
Tommy Smith could not see them, although
he felt them directly. The hind
legs and feet were much smaller, and not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
nearly so strong, which, the mole said, was
because they had not so much work to do.
Between them there was a very short tail,
just long enough, Tommy Smith thought,
to take hold of and lift the mole up by.
But he did not do this, in case he should
be offended. “Well,” said the mole, after
Tommy Smith had looked at him for a
little while, “what do you think of me? I
hope you think me handsome.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think you are,” Tommy Smith
answered, though he did not feel quite sure
of this. “At anyrate, your fur is handsome,
for it is like velvet.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the mole; “and, do you
know, I am sometimes called the little
gentleman in the black velvet coat.”</p>

<p>“It is not quite black,” said Tommy
Smith. “There is a greyish colour in it
too. I think it would look very pretty if
it was made into something. Oh, Mr.
Mole,” he cried all of a sudden, “now I
remember that I have heard people talk
about moleskin waistcoats!”</p>

<p>At this the mole gave a little squeak,
and jumped quite out of Tommy Smith’s
hand, and then he began to burrow into
the ground as fast as he could, and this was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
very fast indeed, so that before Tommy
Smith had got over his surprise, he was
almost out of sight. “Oh, Mr. Mole,” he
cried, “do come back!” but the mole was
very angry, and would not consent to for
some time.</p>

<p>“If I do,” he said at last, “you must
promise me never to talk in that way again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I never will,” said Tommy Smith.
“I quite forgot who I was talking to.”</p>

<p>“Moleskin waistcoats, indeed!” said the
mole. “I think the people who wear them
are very wicked people. They never think
how many poor little moles must be killed
only to make one. I hope <i>you</i> have never
worn a waistcoat like that?”</p>

<p>“Oh no,” answered Tommy Smith, “I
never have. Nobody has ever given me
one.”</p>

<p>“I hope you never will,” said the mole;
“for if you do, you will be almost as
wicked a man as a mole-catcher, and he
is the wickedest person I know of.”</p>

<p>“A mole-catcher!” cried Tommy Smith;
“then are there men who catch moles?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, indeed there are,” said the
mole. “There are men who do that and
nothing else.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>“How do they do it?” asked Tommy
Smith.</p>

<p>“They have traps,” answered the mole,
“which they put in the passages and
corridors of our great underground
palaces.”</p>

<p>“Your houses, I suppose, you mean,”
said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“I mean what I say,” said the mole.
“You may live in a house, I daresay, but I
think the place that I live in is quite large
and fine enough to be called a palace, so I
call it one.”</p>

<p>“Oh! but it cannot be so big as the
house that I live in,” said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the mole, “I should just
like to know how long the longest corridor
in your house is.”</p>

<p>Tommy Smith thought to himself a
little. The house he lived in was not a
very large one, for his father was not a
<i>very</i> rich man. There were not many
passages in it, and he did not think the
longest of them was long enough to be
called a corridor. Still, he thought that
they must be longer than the passages of a
mole’s house, and he couldn’t help feeling
rather proud as he said, “Oh! I don’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
know exactly, because I have never
measured it, but perhaps it is six yards
long.”</p>

<p>“Six yards?” cried the mole. “Do you
call <i>that</i> a corridor? Why, some of mine
are more than twenty times as long as
that. You might walk over a whole field
without coming to the end of them. And
how many corridors has your house got,
then?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I think there are three,” said
Tommy Smith; but this time he didn’t
feel nearly so proud.</p>

<p>“Good gracious!” cried the mole.
“Why, yours must be a very poor place
to live in. I wish I could show you over
my palace, but you are such an awkward
size that you would never be able to get
into it. My corridors are longer than
yours, but they are not nearly so high.
However, perhaps it is just as well that
you can’t get into it, for if you were once
there, I am sure you would never want to
go back again.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps, Mr. Mole,” said Tommy
Smith, “as you can’t show me over it, you
will tell me what it is like.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the mole, “I will; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
perhaps, if you are always a good boy, and
<i>never</i> think of wearing a moleskin waistcoat,
I will show it you some day from the
outside; but that can only be when I
have done with it, and am going to build a
new one, for I should have to break open
the roof for you to see into it. Well, then,
the principal part of my palace is called
the keep, or fortress,&mdash;<i>I</i> call it the fortress.
It is very large, and the roof goes up into
a beautiful, high dome. You know what a
dome is, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” said Tommy Smith; for once
he had been to London, and he remembered
the dome of St. Paul’s Cathedral.</p>

<p>“I wish you could see how high and
stately it is,” said the mole. “It goes
right up into the bush ever so high.”</p>

<p>“You mean ‘into the air,’ I think,” said
Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“I mean what I say,” said the mole;
“into the bush. That is why you can’t
see it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I can see it,” said Tommy
Smith. “I can always find your fortresses,
Mr. Mole. I see lots of them every time
I go out walking. They are not hidden at
all. Why, there they are all over the field,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
and you know you told me to look at them
yourself.”</p>

<p>The mole gave a little choky laugh.
“Oh dear!” he cried, “and do you
<i>really</i> think that <i>those</i> are my fortresses?
You are <i>very</i> much mistaken if you do.
Why, they are only the hills that I throw
up when I am making my tunnels and
corridors. All you will find if you open
them is a hole going down into one of
those. Oh no; my fortress is not built
there. It is carefully hidden under a bush
or the root of a tree, so that you can’t see
it, however high it is. Only the wicked
mole-catcher is able to find it, and I am
very sorry he can.”</p>

<p>This was a great surprise to Tommy
Smith, for he had always thought that the
mole lived under those little brown heaps
of earth. But he had only thought so
because he had never taken any trouble to
find out about it. “I see you are cleverer
than I thought, Mr. Mole,” he said; “but
I should like you to tell me something
more about your palace and fortress.”</p>

<p>“I told you that it was very large,” said
the mole, “and that it went up into a high
dome outside. Inside, it is not nearly so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
high, but it is very nice and comfortable;
and the floor and the sides and ceiling are
always quite smooth and polished, for I
polish them myself, and never leave it to
the servants.”</p>

<p>“But how do you polish them?” said
Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Why, with my fur to be sure,” said the
mole. “I prefer that to a piece of wash-leather.”
(He laughed again as he said
this, but Tommy Smith didn’t know what
for.) “My fur, as you see, is smooth too.
If you were to walk down one of my
corridors, you would be surprised to find
how hard and smooth the sides of it are.
That is because I am always running up
and down them, and rubbing them with
my fur.”</p>

<p>“But doesn’t that make you very
dirty?” said Tommy Smith. “Surely the
earth must get into your fur and stay
there.”</p>

<p>“It <i>never</i> stays there,” said the mole
with great pride. “I have a very strong
muscle which runs all along my back just
under the skin, and when I twitch that,
every little piece of mould or earth that
is in my fur flies out of it again. There!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
now I have twitched it. Look at me and
see how clean I am, although I have only
just come out of the ground. Oh no; there
is never anything in <i>my</i> coat! It is a saying
in our family that a mole <i>may</i> live in
the dirt, but he is never <i>dirty</i>.”</p>

<p>“That seems very funny,” said Tommy
Smith. “But tell me some more about
the fortress that you live in.”</p>

<p>“That is just what I was going to do,”
said the mole, “but you ask so many
questions, that I am not able to get on.
Now I will begin again, and perhaps it
would be better if you were to say nothing
till I have done.”</p>

<p>So Tommy Smith sat down on the
ground to listen, and the mole went on in
these words:</p>

<p>“Inside my fortress there is a large
room which is quite round. I call it my
bedroom or dormitory, because sometimes
I go to sleep there. There are two
different ways of getting into it. One of
them is by the floor, and that is easy. But
the second way is by the ceiling, and that
is much more difficult.”</p>

<p>“By the floor and the ceiling?” cried
Tommy Smith, quite forgetting what the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
mole had said. “How very funny! I get
into <i>my</i> room through a door in one of the
sides.”</p>

<p>“Dear me!” said the mole. “Well, I
should not like to enter a room in that
way.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“The idea of such a thing!” said the
mole. “As for doors, they are things I
don’t understand. Galleries and tunnels
are what I use, and I think them much
grander.”</p>

<p>“But”&mdash;Tommy Smith was beginning.</p>

<p>“Let me get on,” said the mole. “I
have two galleries inside my fortress, an
upper one and a lower one. The lower
one is the largest. It runs all round the
ceiling of my bedroom. From it there are
five little passages which run up into the
upper one. That goes round in a circle
too, but it is high up inside the dome of
my fortress, and a long way above the
ceiling of my bedroom. So what do you
think I have done? I have made three
little tunnels, which go from my upper
gallery right into the top of my bedroom.
I just run down one of them, and tumble
into it through the ceiling.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>“But can’t you get into your bedroom
from the lower gallery too?” asked
Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Oh no,” said the mole; “that would
never do. It would be so easy; and a mole
likes to do things that are difficult. I go
into my lower gallery first, and then I go
from that into my upper gallery. I can
go by five different passages, and choose
which I like.”</p>

<p>“Five different passages! That is a lot,”
cried Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Yes; and there are three more from the
upper gallery into the bedroom!” said the
mole. “How many doors are there into
<i>your</i> rooms?”</p>

<p>“Oh, one,” said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Only one!” said the mole. “That is
very sad. Why, if I had only one tunnel
into my room I should be almost ashamed
to go through it. But then you have only
a house to live in, and not a palace, as I
have.”</p>

<p>Tommy Smith thought that this was
rather a grand way of talking, and he was
just beginning, “Perhaps, if you were to
see my house”&mdash;when the mole went on
with, “Of course, such a fine palace as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
mine ought to have a good many fine
roads leading up to it.”</p>

<p>“Ought it?” said Tommy Smith; “and
how many has it?”</p>

<p>“Seven,” said the mole.</p>

<p>“Seven!” exclaimed Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the mole, “and I make them
all myself. Why, how many has yours?”</p>

<p>“It has only one,” said Tommy Smith,
“but I think that is quite enough.”</p>

<p>“For a house, perhaps, it may be,” said the
mole; “but <i>I</i> should be sorry to have to
put up with it. <i>My palace</i> has seven, and
I know some very rich moles who have
eight. These are the great corridors which
some people call the high roads. Some of
them run through fine avenues of tree-roots,
and, you know, a fine avenue of tree-roots
has a splendid appearance. They
wind all about, and go for ever such a way,
and there are smaller corridors which run
out of them on each side, and spread all
over the fields.”</p>

<p>“You mean <i>under</i> the fields, Mr. Mole,”
said Tommy Smith; “for, you know, the
grass grows over your corridors, and
nobody can see them.”</p>

<p>“I am very glad they can’t,” said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
mole, “or my bedroom, or my nursery
either.”</p>

<p>“What, have you a nursery too?” said
Tommy Smith. “Why, that is just as if
you were a person.”</p>

<p>“Of course I have a nursery,” said the
mole. “What should I do with my
children if I had not? I could not have
them always in the fortress, or playing
about in the corridors. They would be
quite out of place there, and very much in
the way. So I have a nursery for them,
and they lie there upon a nice warm bed,
which I make myself, of young grass and
other soft things.”</p>

<p>“Oh, then I suppose that you are the
mother mole,” said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am,” said the mole; “and you
should call me Mrs. Mole, and not Mr. as
you have been doing; and as for my
being like a person, why, I am one, of
course, and an important person too, <i>I</i>
think. Why, do you know that I drain the
land?”</p>

<p>“Do you really, Mrs. Mole?” said
Tommy Smith; “but is not that very
difficult?”</p>

<p>“You would find it so, I daresay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>”
answered the mole, “but to me it is quite
easy.”</p>

<p>“How do you do it?” asked Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Why, by digging to be sure,” the mole
said. “I just make my tunnels, and my
trenches, and my corridors, and then when
the rain comes it runs off into them, and
doesn’t lie on the ground so long as it
would if they were not there.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but if the water runs into your
tunnels,” said Tommy Smith, “how is it
that you are not drowned?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it does not stay there long enough
for that,” said the mole; “and, besides, I
am a very good swimmer. Just take me
up again and put me into that little pond
there, and I will show you,”&mdash;for there was
a pond not far off where some ducks and
geese were swimming about. “Drive those
rude things away first,” said the mother
mole, as Tommy Smith stood with her in
his hand, at the edge of the pond, just
ready to drop her in. “If they see me,
they will be sure to make some rude
remark, and, indeed, there is no saying
what liberties they might take.”</p>

<p>So Tommy Smith drove away the ducks
and geese, and then dropped the mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
mole into the water, and,&mdash;would you
believe it?&mdash;she swam almost as well
as if she had been a duck or a goose
herself, moving all her four little feet at
a great rate, and going along very quickly.
She <i>did</i> look so funny. She went across
the pond, and then turned round and came
back again, and, as she scuttled out on to
the bank, she said, “So now you see that
a mole can swim. Can <i>you</i>?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Tommy Smith; for he
had not learnt to, yet.</p>

<p>“Dear me,” said the mother mole, “you
cannot swim, or dig, or drain the ground,
and I am so much smaller and can do all
three, besides a great many other things.
But then <i>I</i> am a mole.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say that I couldn’t dig,” Tommy
Smith said. “I can, a little, only <i>I</i> do it with
a spade. I mean a real spade,” he added.
“Of course, I can’t do it with my hands.”</p>

<p>“What stupid hands!” said the mole.
“Why, what <i>can</i> they be good for? But
are you sure you could dig properly, even
if you had a spade? Do you think you
could do anything useful now? For
instance, could you dig a well?”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t like to do it all by myself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>”
said Tommy Smith; “it would take me a
very long time. But I don’t suppose <i>you</i>
dig wells either.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t you!” said the mole; “then
how do you think we get our water to drink
when the weather is dry? Of course, if we
have a pond or a ditch near us we can
easily make a tunnel to the edge of it, but
it is not every mole who is so fortunate as
to live by the waterside. Those who do
not, have to dig deep pits for the water to
run into; for I must tell you that there is
always water to be found in the earth, if
only you dig deep enough for it. If you
make a hole which goes right down into
the ground, very soon the water will begin
to trickle into it through the sides and the
bottom, and then, of course, it is a well.
I wish you could see some of our wells.
They are so nicely made, and sometimes
they are brim full.”</p>

<p>“So you have real wells with water in
them!” cried Tommy Smith; for it seemed
to him so very funny that moles should
have wells as well as men.</p>

<p>“To be sure, we have,” said the mole;
“and I think it is very clever of us to have
thought of it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, it is indeed,” said Tommy Smith;
“and I begin to think that all the animals
are clever.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about <i>that</i>,” said the mole;
“but <i>we</i> are.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes; and so is the rat, and the frog,
and the peewit, and”&mdash;</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear it,” said the mole.
“<i>I</i> should not have thought so.”</p>

<p>“Oh! but they are really,” Tommy
Smith went on eagerly. “Do let me tell
you how the peewit”&mdash;</p>

<p>“I have nothing to learn from <i>him</i>, I
hope,” said the mole; “a poor foolish bird
who wastes all his time in the air.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but if you only knew how the
mother peewit”&mdash;Tommy Smith was beginning
again.</p>

<p>“I should be sorry to take <i>her</i> as an
example,” said the mole sharply; “she is
a flighty thing, without solid qualities.
Other animals may be all very well in
their way,” she went on, after a pause,
“but they are not <i>moles</i>, and they none
of them know how to dig.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but the rabbit”&mdash;</p>

<p>“The rabbit, indeed!” cried the mole
very indignantly. “Why, what can <i>he</i> do?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
He can just make a clumsy hole, and that
is all. He is a mere labourer; and I hope
you do not compare him with a real artist
like myself.”</p>

<p>“Oh no,” said Tommy Smith; but he
thought the mole was very conceited.</p>

<p>“Not that it is his fault,” the mole continued.
“Of course, he cannot be expected
to make such wonderful places as I do.
After all, what has he got to dig with?
His feet are only paws, they are not
spades, as mine are; and then he has
two great big eyes for the dirt to get
into, which must be a great inconvenience
to him.”</p>

<p>“But haven’t you eyes, too, Mrs. Mole?”
asked Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Would you like to try and find them?”
answered the mole. “You may, if you
like.”</p>

<p>So Tommy Smith knelt down on the
ground and began to look all about where
he thought the mole’s eyes were likely to
be, and to feel with his fingers in the fur.
But look and feel as he might, it was no
use, he couldn’t find the eyes anywhere.
But, just as he was going to give up trying,
all at once he thought he saw two little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
black things hardly so big as the head of
a small black pin. Could those be eyes?
Tommy Smith hardly believed that they
could be, for some time; they were so <i>very</i>
small. “Are those your eyes, Mrs. Mole?”
he asked at last.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed they are,” the mother mole
answered; “and are they not a beautiful
pair? How difficult they are to find, and
how well my fur hides them! It would
not be easy for the mould to get into <i>them</i>;
<i>they</i> are not like those great staring things
of the rabbit.”</p>

<p>“They are very small,” said Tommy
Smith.</p>

<p>“I should think so!” said the mole;
“and what an advantage it is to have
small eyes.”</p>

<p>“But can you see with them?” said
Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Oh no,” said the mole; “and what
an advantage it is not to be able to
see.”</p>

<p>Tommy Smith did not understand this
at all. “The rabbit can see,” he said, “and
so can all the other animals.”</p>

<p>“<i>They</i> are obliged to,” answered the
mole, “and so they have to put up with it;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
but a mole lives in the dark, and therefore
it does not require to see.”</p>

<p>“But what are eyes for, if they are not
to see with?” Tommy Smith asked. He
felt sure it was a sensible question, and it
seemed to him that the mole was talking
nonsense.</p>

<p>“They are for not getting in the way
when you make tunnels in the ground,”
said the mole. “Mine never get in the
way, so I know that they are the best eyes
that anyone can have.”</p>

<p>This was quite a new idea to Tommy
Smith, and he tried to think what it would
be like to live in the ground, and to have
eyes that you couldn’t see with, and that
didn’t get in the way. At last he said,
“It seems to me, Mrs. Mole, that it would
be much better if you had not any eyes
at all.”</p>

<p>“That is a strange idea, to be sure!”
said the mole. “Not have eyes, indeed!
That would be a fine thing.”</p>

<p>“But if you can’t see with them,” said
Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“What of that?” said the mole; “we
have them, and so we are proud of them.
It is a saying in our family that a mole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
<i>may</i> be blind, but he has <i>eyes</i> for all
that.”</p>

<p>“Poor little mole,” said Tommy Smith,
for though the animal seemed to be quite
happy itself, he couldn’t help feeling very
sorry for it. “But are you <i>quite</i> blind?”</p>

<p>“If I am not quite, I am very nearly,”
the mole answered, “and I am thankful
for <i>that</i>. I just know when it is light
and when it isn’t, which is all a mole
requires to know.”</p>

<p>“But can’t you see me?” Tommy Smith
asked.</p>

<p>“You, indeed!” answered the mole.
“And why should I want to see you?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you <i>are</i> blind,” Tommy
Smith said quite sadly.</p>

<p>“At anyrate,” said the mole, “I have
less seeing to do than almost any other
animal, and, when I think of that, I can’t
<i>help</i> feeling proud, though I know I
oughtn’t to be. But I think you have
talked enough about my eyes,” the mole
continued. “Perhaps you would like to
know something about my teeth now.
Look! there they are,” and she opened
her mouth as wide as she could, which
was not very wide, for her mouth was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
so small. What funny little white teeth
they were, and how sharp,&mdash;as sharp and
as pointed as needles.</p>

<p>“Why are they so pointed?” asked
Tommy Smith. “The rabbit’s teeth are
not at all like that, and the rat’s are not
either.”</p>

<p>“It is because we eat different things,”
said the mole. “Different kinds of animals
have different food, and so they have
different kinds of teeth to eat it with.
Mine are nice and sharp, because they
have to bite and kill whatever they
catch hold of.”</p>

<p>“But what is it that they have to bite
and kill?” said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Ah, you would never guess,” answered
the mole. “You must know that we
moles are very brave animals, and we
fight a great deal; sometimes with each
other, but mostly with great serpents
which live in the ground, although it
really belongs to us.”</p>

<p>“Serpents?” said Tommy Smith. “Why,
do you mean snakes?”</p>

<p>“Of course I do,” said the mole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>“Snakes that live in the ground!”
Tommy Smith cried. “Why, I don’t
know of any that do. The grass-snake
doesn’t, or the adder either. What are
these snakes like, Mrs. Mole?”</p>

<p>“They are smooth and slimy,” said
the mole. “They have no head, or, if
they have, it looks like another tail, and
they are always crawling through the
ground, which is ours, of course, and
trying to break into our palaces.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I call those worms!” said
Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“You may call them so if you like,”
said the mole, “but <i>I</i> call them snakes.
You should see the way I fight with
them! How they writhe and twist
about when I seize them between my
sharp teeth. They try hard to get
away, and they would kill me if only
they could. But I am too brave and
too strong for them, so I kill <i>them</i>
instead, and eat them as well. We
moles are very heroic.”</p>

<p>“Do you eat anything else?” asked
Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Caterpillars sometimes, and a beetle
or two,” answered the mole. “But I
like snakes best of all.”</p>

<p>“Worms,” said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>“Snakes,” said the mole. But Tommy
Smith was right, the mole’s snakes were
harmless worms; but it is nice to think
oneself a hero.</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” said the mole rather
suddenly. “I am tired of talking, and
I want to have a little sleep.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but it is the middle of the day,”
said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“What of that?” said the mole. “I
feel tired, so I shall go to sleep.”</p>

<p>“Then do you always sleep in the
daytime?” asked Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“I know nothing about daytime or
nighttime,” the mole answered, “and
perhaps if you lived under the ground,
as I do, you would not either. I feel
tired <i>now</i>, so I shall go to sleep now.
Good-bye”; and the mother mole began
to sink into the earth, and all at once
she was gone,&mdash;just as Tommy Smith
was going to ask her what was the use
of having such a grand palace to live
in if she was blind and couldn’t see it.</p>

<p>One sometimes thinks of a good question
just too late to ask it.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="small">THE WOODPIGEON</span></h2>

<p class="pp6q">“<i>The woodpigeon greets Tommy Smith with a coo,<br />
Which he modifies slightly to ‘How do you do?’</i>”</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">WHAT could be more beautiful
than the woods that fine spring
morning on which Tommy Smith walked
through them? The sky was blue, and
the air was soft, and the birds were
singing everywhere. There was a concert,
surely; the trees had given it. That is
what came into Tommy Smith’s head,
and perhaps he was right. It is in
spring that the season begins. Then
ladies and gentlemen dress themselves
finely, and come and stand together in
a crowd, and there is talking, and
laughing, and singing. And here in the
woods the trees had all put on fine new
dresses of bright green, for <i>their</i> season
of spring had come, and green was the
fashionable colour. <i>They</i> stood together
too,&mdash;ever so many of them,&mdash;and bent
their heads towards each other, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
seemed to be whispering. Then their
leaves rustled, which was a much
pleasanter sound than ladies’ and gentlemen’s
talking and laughing (though perhaps
it did not mean <i>quite</i> as much);
and, oh! what beautiful sounds came
from their midst. Tommy Smith knew
that it was not the trees who were
singing, but the birds in them. “But
it seems as if it were the trees,” he
thought, “because I can’t see the birds.
But perhaps the trees ask the birds to
sing for them, as we ask people to play
and sing for us. That is how they
give their concerts and parties, perhaps.
The large ones are like rich people who
can afford to hire a whole band, but the
little ones and the bushes are the people
who are not so well off, and <i>they</i> can
only have a bird or two.” Tommy
Smith thought all this, because he was
a little boy, and liked to pretend things,
but a long time afterwards, when he was
much wiser, he used to remember those
walks of his in the woods, and sometimes
he would say to himself, “Yes, those were
the best seasons; those were the concerts
and parties most worth going to.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>A fallen tree lay across Tommy Smith’s
path. It had once been a tall, stately oak,
now it made a nice mossy seat for a little
boy. We are not all of us so useful
when we grow old. “I will sit down on
it,” thought Tommy Smith, “and listen to
the birds singing, and pretend they are
people, and not birds at all.” So Tommy
Smith sat down and listened. A thrush
was sitting on the very tip-top of a high
fir tree, and soon he began to fill the
whole air with his beautiful, clear, joyous
notes. “I like that as well as the piano,”
said Tommy Smith, “and I don’t think
I know any lady who could sing such a
beautiful song.” Then the robin began.
“That is lower and sweeter,” he thought.
“<i>People</i> make a great deal more noise
when they sing, but it doesn’t seem to
mean so much, or, if it does, I don’t like
the meaning so well. Then a jay screamed,
and some starlings began to chatter. “Oh,
there!” cried Tommy Smith, clapping his
hands. “That is much more like people.
Ladies talk and sing just like that. But
not like <i>that</i>,” he continued; for now
another sound began to mingle with the
rest, such a pretty, such a <i>very</i> pretty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
sound, <i>so</i> soft, and so tender and sleepy,
“like a lullaby,” Tommy Smith thought.
And, as he listened to it, all the woods
seemed to grow hushed and still, as if
they were listening too. “Oh,” said
Tommy Smith, “it is no use pretending
any more. That couldn’t be people.
No men, and no women either, have
such a pretty voice as that.”</p>

<p>“Coo-oo-oo-oo, coo-oo-oo-oo,” said the
voice. It had been some way off before,
but now it sounded much nearer. “Coo-oo-oo-oo,
coo-oo-oo-oo.” Why, surely it
was in that tree, only just a little way
from where Tommy Smith was sitting.
“I will go and look,” he thought. “I
know who it is. It is the woodpigeon.
Perhaps he will stay and talk to me.”</p>

<p>So he got up, and walked towards the
tree. But&mdash;was it not strange?&mdash;as he
came to it the voice seemed to change just
a little. Only just a little; it had still the
same pretty, soft sound, and the end part
was just the same, but, instead of “Coo-oo-oo-oo,
coo-oo-oo-oo,” which it had been
saying before, now it was saying&mdash;yes, and
quite distinctly too&mdash;“How do you do-oo-oo-oo?
How do you do-oo-oo-oo?” Yes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
there could be no doubt of it, and as
Tommy Smith came quite up to the tree,
there was the woodpigeon sitting on one
of the lowest branches, bowing to him
quite politely, and asking him how he was.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am quite well, Mr. Woodpigeon,”
answered Tommy Smith. “I
hope you are.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am quite well too-oo-oo-oo,”
cooed the woodpigeon, bobbing his head
up and down all the while.</p>

<p>“Why do you move your head up and
down like that whilst you speak?” asked
Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Why, because it is the proper thing to
do-oo-oo-oo,” replied the woodpigeon.</p>

<p>“But <i>I</i> don’t do it when <i>I</i> speak,” said
Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Oh no; but then <i>I</i> am not you-oo-oo-oo,”
said the woodpigeon.</p>

<p>Tommy Smith didn’t know how to
answer this, so he thought he would
change the subject. “What have you
been doing this morning, Mr. Woodpigeon?”
he said.</p>

<p>“Why, sitting here in the woo-oo-oo-oods
and coo-oo-oo-ing,” the woodpigeon
answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, but not all the morning, have
you?” said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Oh no,” said the woodpigeon. “From
about six to nine I was having my breakfast
in the fields.”</p>

<p>Tommy Smith thought that three hours
was a very long time to take over one’s
breakfast, and he said so. “I don’t take
half an hour over mine,” he added.</p>

<p>“That is all very well,” said the woodpigeon;
“but your breakfast is brought to
you, whilst I have to find mine for myself.
What you eat is put down before you on
a table, but <i>my</i> table is the whole country,
and it is so large and broad that it takes
me a long while to find what is on it, and
to eat as much of it as I want.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what your breakfast is like,
Mr. Woodpigeon,” said Tommy Smith.
“I suppose it is very different to mine.”</p>

<p>“Let me see,” cooed the woodpigeon.
“This morning I had a few peas and
beans, besides some oats and barley. I
got those in the fields, and I found some
green clover there too, as well as some
wild mustard, and some ragweed and
charlock, and a few other seeds and roo-oo-oo-oots.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh dear, Mr. Woodpigeon,” said
Tommy Smith; “why, what a lot you do
eat.”</p>

<p>“I don’t call that much,” said the woodpigeon.
“When I was tired of looking
about in the fields, I went to the woods
again, and got a few acorns, and some
beechnuts, and”&mdash;</p>

<p>“Oh! but look here, Mr. Woodpigeon,”
said Tommy Smith. “You couldn’t have
eaten all those this morning, because they
are not all ripe now, and”&mdash;</p>

<p>“I didn’t say they were ripe,” said the
woodpigeon; “and if I didn’t eat them
this morning, then I did on some other
morning, so it’s all the same. Those are
the things I eat, at anyrate, and I can’t be
expected to remember exactly when I eat
them. I had a few stones though, of
course. They are always to be had, whatever
time of year it is. <i>Stones</i> are <i>always</i>
in season.”</p>

<p>“Stones!” cried Tommy Smith in great
surprise. “Oh, come now; I know you
don’t eat them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t I?” said the woodpigeon.
“I should be very sorry if I couldn’t get
any,&mdash;I know that. It would be a nice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
thing, indeed, if one couldn’t have a few
stones to eat with one’s meals. That
would be a good joke.”</p>

<p>Tommy Smith thought that <i>he</i> wouldn’t
think it a joke to <i>have</i> to eat stones, and
he could hardly believe that the woodpigeon
was speaking the truth. But he
was such an innocent-looking bird, and
seemed so <i>very</i> respectable, that he
thought he must be. “Are they very
large stones?” he asked at last.</p>

<p>“Oh no,” answered the woodpigeon.
“They are not large, but very small&mdash;just
the right size to go into my mill.”</p>

<p>“Into your mill?” said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the woodpigeon; “the little
mill which is inside me.”</p>

<p>Tommy Smith was getting more and
more puzzled. What could the woodpigeon
mean? “And yet he is such a
nice bird,” he said to himself. “I don’t
think he would tell stories.”</p>

<p>“I see that you don’t understand me,”
said the woodpigeon; “so, if you like, I
will explain it all to you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I should so like to know!” said
Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>So the woodpigeon gave a gentle coo,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
and began to tell him all about it. “Yes,”
he said, “I have a mill inside me, and
everything that I eat goes into it to get
ground up.”</p>

<p>“Why, then, you are a miller,” said
Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“In a way, I am,” said the woodpigeon;
“for I own a mill. But then, you know, a
miller lives inside <i>his</i> mill, but <i>my</i> mill is
inside me.”</p>

<p>“I should so like to see it,” said Tommy
Smith.</p>

<p>“You never can do that,” said the woodpigeon
in an alarmed tone of voice; “for
you would have to kill me first, and that
would be a most shocking thing to do.
But it is there, all the same, though you
can’t see it, and it is called the gizzard.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the gizzard!” said Tommy Smith.
“I know what that is, because I have”&mdash;and
then he stopped all of a sudden. He
had been going to say that he had tasted it
sometimes when there was fowl for dinner,
but he thought he had better not. It
didn’t seem quite delicate to talk to a
woodpigeon about eating a fowl.</p>

<p>“The gizzard is the mill that I am
talking about,” said the woodpigeon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
“All the food that we eat goes into it,
and then it is ground up, just as corn is
ground between two hard stones. But
though our gizzard is very hard, it is not
quite so hard as stones are, so we swallow
some small sharp stones, which go into our
gizzard, and are rolled about with the
grain and seeds there, and help to crush
them. Then, when they are nice and soft,
they are ready to go on into the stomach.
So now you know what sort of thing a
gizzard is, and why we swallow stones.”</p>

<p>“But don’t the stones hurt you?” asked
Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Do you think we would swallow them
if they did?” answered the woodpigeon.
“What a foolish question to ask!”</p>

<p>Tommy Smith stood for a little while
thinking about it, and wondering if <i>he</i>
had a mill inside <i>him</i>, till at last the woodpigeon
said, “Perhaps you would like to
ask me a <i>sensible</i> question.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” said Tommy Smith, and he
tried to think what was a sensible question.
He had thought of a good many
questions to ask, and they had seemed
sensible at the time, but now he began
to feel afraid that the woodpigeon would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
think them foolish. At last he said, “Please,
Mr. Woodpigeon, where do you live?”</p>

<p>“Oh, in this tree,” said the woodpigeon,
“half-way up on the seventeenth storey.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you mean the seventeenth
branch,” said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Of course I do,” said the woodpigeon.
“I have my nest there, and my wife is
sitting on the eggs now.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do let me see them,” cried Tommy
Smith.</p>

<p>“Oh no,” said the woodpigeon. “They
are too high up for that. You would not
be able to climb so far, and you cannot
fly as we birds do, for you are only a
poor boy, and have no wings.”</p>

<p>“I wish I had wings,” said Tommy
Smith. “Is it very nice to fly, Mr. Woodpigeon?”</p>

<p>“It is nicer than anything else in the
whole world,” the woodpigeon answered.
“Just fancy floating along high above
everything, as if the air were water, and
you were a boat. Only you go much
quicker than a boat does, and sometimes
you need not use the oars at all.”</p>

<p>“Your wings are the oars, I suppose,”
said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” said the woodpigeon,
“and how fast they row me along.
Swish! swish! swish! and when I am
tired I just spread them out and float
along without using them. That is
delightful. I call it resting on my
wings.”</p>

<p>“It must be something like swinging,
I think,” said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the woodpigeon; “only you
swing upon nothing, and you only swing
forwards. Oh, how cool and fresh the
air is, even on the hottest day in summer!
The sun seems shining quite near to me,
and the sky is like a great blue sea that
I am swimming through; but oh, so
quickly! quicker than any fish can swim.
When I look up, I see great white ships
with all their sails set. They are the
clouds, and sometimes I am quite near
them. How fast we go! We seem to
be chasing each other. And when I look
down, I see green islands far below me.
Those are the tops of trees that I am
flying over. My nest is in one of them,
and I always know which one it is.
When I am above it, I pause as a boat
pauses on the crest of a wave, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
down, down, down I go, such a deep,
cool, delicious plunge, till at last the
leaves rustle round me, and I am sitting
amongst the branches again, and cooing.”</p>

<p>“By your nest?” asked Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Oh yes; when I have one,” said the
woodpigeon. “I have now, you know,
because it is the springtime.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could see it with the eggs
in it,” said Tommy Smith. But it was
no use wishing, he hadn’t wings, and he
couldn’t climb the tree. “How many
eggs are there?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Two-oo-oo-oo,” said a voice, higher
up amongst the foliage; and Tommy
Smith knew that the mother woodpigeon
was sitting there on her nest, and looking
down at him all the while.</p>

<p>“Only two eggs!” he said. “I don’t
call that many.”</p>

<p>“It may not be <i>many</i>,” said the mother
woodpigeon, “but it is the right quantity.
Three would be <i>too</i> many, and one would
not be enough. Two is the only possible
number.”</p>

<p>“Oh no, indeed it isn’t,” said Tommy
Smith eagerly. “Fowls lay a dozen eggs
sometimes, and pheasants”&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>“Possible for a woodpigeon, <i>I</i> meant,”
said the mother woodpigeon. “With
fowls, no doubt, anything may take place,
but large families are considered vulgar
amongst <i>us</i>.”</p>

<p>“Fowls may do what they please,” said
the father woodpigeon. “They are lazy
birds, and don’t feed their young ones.”</p>

<p>“That is why they lay so many eggs,”
said the mother woodpigeon. “They
don’t mind having a herd of children,
because they know they won’t have to
support them.”</p>

<p>Tommy Smith was surprised to hear
the woodpigeons talk like this of the
poor fowls, for he had often seen the
good mother hen walking about with her
brood of children, calling to them when
she found a worm, and taking care of
them so nicely. “It seems to me,” he
thought, “that every animal thinks itself
better than every other animal; and they
all think whatever they do right, just
because they do it, and the others don’t.
But I suppose <i>that</i> is because they <i>are</i>
animals, and not human beings.” Then
he said out loud, “But I am sure the
mother hen feeds her chickens, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
I have seen her scratching up worms for
them out of the ground, and”&mdash;</p>

<p>“Yes, that is a nice way to feed one’s
little ones,” said the mother woodpigeon.
“A raw, live worm! Why, what could
be nastier? No wonder they are forced
to pick up things for themselves.”</p>

<p>“If they waited till their parents put
a worm into their mouths, they would
starve,” said the father woodpigeon. “It
is quite dreadful to think of.”</p>

<p>“But I think the little chickens like
picking up their own food,” said Tommy
Smith. “They look so pretty running
about.”</p>

<p>“They would look much prettier sitting
in a warm nest, as ours do,” said the
mother woodpigeon.</p>

<p>“And they would feel much more
comfortable with you feeding them, my
dear,” said the father.</p>

<p>“And with you helping me, you know,”
said the mother bird, and she stretched
her neck over the branch, and cooed softly
to her husband, who looked up at her, and
cooed again.</p>

<p>“Then do you both feed them?” asked
Tommy Smith.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” said the father woodpigeon;
“and we take it in turns. You would
not find many cocks who would do that,
I think.”</p>

<p>“No; or help to hatch the eggs,” said
the mother woodpigeon. “He does that
too. Oh, he <i>is</i> so good!”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” said the father woodpigeon.
“It is what all birds ought to
do-oo-oo-oo.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but it isn’t what they all do
do-oo-oo-oo,” said the mother woodpigeon.</p>

<p>“More shame for those who do not,”
said the father woodpigeon; “but I hope
there are not many.” And then they
both waited for Tommy Smith to ask
them another question.</p>

<p>“Please, Mrs. Woodpigeon,” said Tommy
Smith, “what do you feed your young ones
with?”</p>

<p>“We feed them with whatever we eat
ourselves,” said the mother woodpigeon,
“and we always swallow it first, to be sure
that it is quite good.”</p>

<p>This surprised Tommy Smith very
much indeed, for it seemed to him
almost as wonderful as eating stones.
“Oh! but if you swallow the food yourselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>”
he said, “how can your young
ones have it?”</p>

<p>“They don’t have it till we bring it
up again,” said the father woodpigeon.
“They put their beaks inside ours, and
then it comes up into our mouths all ready
for them to swallow.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that rather nasty?” said Tommy
Smith.</p>

<p>“You had better ask <i>them</i> about <i>that</i>,”
said the mother woodpigeon. “<i>They</i> will
tell you whether it is nasty or not.”</p>

<p>“<i>They</i> think it <i>nice</i>,” said the father
woodpigeon.</p>

<p>“And no wonder,” said the mother
woodpigeon. “When <i>we</i> swallow it, it is
hard and cold, but when it comes up again
for <i>them</i> to swallow, it is soft and warm,
and very like milk. It is not every bird
who feeds its young ones like <i>that</i>.”</p>

<p>“Oh no,” said Tommy Smith; “most
birds fly to them with a worm or a caterpillar
in their beaks, and give it to them
just as it is.”</p>

<p>“That is the old-fashioned way,” said
the mother woodpigeon; “but we are
more civilised, and have learnt to <i>prepare</i>
our children’s food.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>“Besides,” said the father woodpigeon,
“we eat seeds and grains, and little things
like that, and it would take us a very long
time to carry a sufficient number of them
to the nest. Our young ones would be so
hungry, and we should not be able to
bring them enough to satisfy them, and
then they would starve. So we have
thought of this way of managing it, and I
think it is one of the cleverest things in
the whole world.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” cooed the mother woodpigeon,
as she looked down from the
branch where she sat on her nest; “one
of the cleverest things in the whole
world.”</p>

<p>“Is it only pigeons that do that?” asked
Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“I won’t say that,” answered the mother
woodpigeon. “There are some other birds,
I believe, who have followed our example.”</p>

<p>“Yes, they imitate us,” said the father
woodpigeon; “but they can never be
pigeons, however much they try to be.”</p>

<p>“Never,” said the mother woodpigeon.
“They don’t drink water as we do. That
is the test.”</p>

<p>“Why, how do you drink water?” asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Tommy Smith. “Don’t you drink it like
other birds?”</p>

<p>“I should think not,” said the father
woodpigeon. “Other birds take a little
in their bills, and then lift their heads up
and let it run down their throats, but we
pigeons would be ashamed to drink in such
a way as that. We keep our beaks in the
water all the time, and suck it up into our
throats. That is how <i>we</i> drink, and nothing
could make us do it differently. We don’t
lift <i>our</i> heads up.”</p>

<p>“But why shouldn’t you lift them up?”
said Tommy Smith; for he thought to
himself, “If all the other birds drink like
that, it ought to be the right way.”</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t we?” said the father
woodpigeon. “Why, because it would be
stupid,&mdash;and wrong too,” he added after a
pause, during which he seemed to be
thinking.</p>

<p>“There is a still stronger reason,” said
the mother woodpigeon, “the strongest of
<i>all</i> reasons; at least, <i>I</i> cannot imagine one
stronger. It would be <i>unpigeonly</i>.” And
from the tone in which she said this,
Tommy Smith felt that it would be no
use to say anything more on the subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>“If there was any water here,” said the
father woodpigeon, “I would drink a little
just to show you, but the nearest is some
way off. However, you can watch some
tame pigeons the next time they are
drinking, for we all belong to one great
family, and have the same ideas upon
important points. Now I am going for a
short fly, but if you like to stay and talk to
my wife, I shall be back again in an hour.”</p>

<p>But Tommy Smith had to go too, for
his lessons began at eleven o’clock, and of
course it would not do to miss them,
though it seemed to him that he was getting
a much better lesson from the woodpigeons.
“But I wish,” he said, “before you fly
away, Mr. Woodpigeon, you would just
tell me what you do all day.” But as
Tommy Smith said this, there was a rustle
and a clapping of wings, and the father
woodpigeon was gone.</p>

<p>“He is so impetuous,” said the mother
woodpigeon. “There is no stopping him
when he wants to do anything. But <i>I</i>
will tell you what we do all day, so listen.
We rise early, of course, and fly down to
breakfast at about six. After three or
four hours we come back to the woods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
again, and coo and talk to each other there
for about an hour. Then we go off to
drink and to bathe, which is the nicest
part of the whole day. After that we
feel a little tired and sleepy, so we sit
quietly in the woods till about two. Then
it is quite time for dinner, so off we go
again and feed till about five. After
dinner it is best to sit quiet and coo a
little. A quiet coo aids digestion. Then
we have a nice refreshing drink in the cool
of the evening, and after that we go
straight to tree.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to bed?” said Tommy
Smith.</p>

<p>“Of course I do,” said the mother woodpigeon.
“We sleep in trees. They are
the only beds we should care to trust
ourselves to.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t they rather hard?” said Tommy
Smith.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” said the woodpigeon.
“You see, we have our own feathers, so
that makes them feather-beds. They are
soft enough and warm enough for us, you
may be quite sure.”</p>

<p>“But it must be very windy up in the
trees,” said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>“That is the great advantage of the
situation,” said the mother woodpigeon.
“Our beds are always well aired, so we
need never feel anxious about that. However
much it rains they can never be
damp, for how can a bed be damp and
well-aired at the same time?”</p>

<p>Tommy Smith couldn’t think of the
right answer to this, and the woodpigeon
went on, “So, now, I have told you how
we pass the day. What a happy, happy
life! He must have a cruel heart who
could put an end to it.” (And Tommy
Smith thought so too.)</p>

<p>“But is that what you always do?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Of course, when there are eggs and
young ones it makes a difference,” said the
mother woodpigeon; “and in winter we
keep different hours. But that is our
usual summer life, and <i>I</i> think it a very
pleasant one.”</p>

<p>“Oh, so do I!” said Tommy Smith.
“Thank you, Mrs. Woodpigeon, for telling
me. Now I must go to my lessons,
and I will tell them all about it at
home.”</p>

<p>“If you come back afterwards, I will tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
you some more,” said the mother woodpigeon.</p>

<p>Tommy Smith said he would, and then
he ran away as fast as he could to his
lessons, for he was a little late. And as he
ran, he could hear the mother woodpigeon
saying, “Come back soo-oo-oo-oon! come
back soo-oo-oo-oon!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="small">THE SQUIRREL</span></h2>

<p class="pp6q">“<i>The pert little squirrel’s as brisk as can be;<br />
He calls his house ‘Tree-tops,’ and lives in a tree.</i>”</p>

<p class="drop-cap08">SO Tommy Smith went home to his
lessons, and when he had finished
them, he put on his hat and came out
again, and began to walk through the
woods to where the mother woodpigeon
was waiting for him on her nest.
“Tommy Smith! Tommy Smith! Where
are you going to, Tommy Smith?” said a
voice which he had not heard before. At
any rate, he had not heard it talk before.
Such a funny little voice it was, something
between a cough and a sob, and if it had
not said all those words so <i>very</i> distinctly,
it would have sounded like “sug, sug,&mdash;sug,
sug,&mdash;sug, sug, sug, sug, sug.” Now I
come to think of it, Tommy Smith must
have heard it before, for he had often been
for walks in the woods. But when a voice
which has only said “sug, sug” before,
begins to talk and say whole sentences, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
is not so easy to recognise it. “Who can
that be?” said Tommy Smith; and then he
looked all about, but he could see no one.
“Who are you?” he called out; “and where
are you calling me from?”</p>

<p>“From here, Tommy Smith, from here,”
answered the voice. “Can’t you see me?
Why here I am.”</p>

<p>“Are you the rabbit?” said Tommy
Smith; but he thought directly, “Oh no, it
can’t be the rabbit, because it comes from a
tree, and no rabbit could burrow up a tree.”</p>

<p>“The rabbit, indeed!” said the voice.
“Oh no, I am not the rabbit. That <i>is</i> a
funny sug, sug, sug, sug-gestion.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know!” cried Tommy Smith.
“It is the”&mdash;</p>

<p>“Look!” said the voice. And all at
once there was a red streak down the
trunk of a beech tree and along the
ground, and there was a little squirrel
sitting at Tommy Smith’s feet, with his tail
cocked up over his head. “Oh!” cried
Tommy Smith,&mdash;and before he could say
anything else the squirrel said “Look!”
again, and there was another red streak, up
the trunk of a pine tree this time,&mdash;and
there he was sitting on a branch of it, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
his tail cocked up over his head, just the
same as before.</p>

<p>“Oh dear, Mr. Squirrel,” said Tommy
Smith&mdash;the branch was not a very high
one, and they could talk to each other
comfortably&mdash;“how fast you do go!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I like to do things quickly,” said
the squirrel. “Mine is an active nature
during three-parts of the year.”</p>

<p>“And what is it during the other part?”
asked Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know anything about it
then,” the squirrel answered.</p>

<p>This puzzled Tommy Smith a little.
“Why not?” he said.</p>

<p>“Oh, because I’m asleep,” said the
squirrel. “One can’t know much about
oneself when one’s asleep, you know; and,
besides, it doesn’t matter.”</p>

<p>“But do you go to sleep for such a long
time?” said Tommy Smith. “I know that
the frogs and the snakes go to sleep all the
winter, but I didn’t know any regular
animal did.”</p>

<p>“Why, doesn’t the dormouse?” said the
squirrel. “He’s a much harder sleeper
than I am. I suppose you call <i>him</i> a
regular animal.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh yes,” said Tommy Smith. He had
forgotten the dormouse, and, of course, <i>he
was</i> a regular animal. By a “regular
animal,” I suppose Tommy Smith meant
one that wasn’t an insect, or a reptile, or a
worm, or something of that sort. Perhaps
he couldn’t have said exactly <i>what</i> he
meant, but whatever he did mean, you
may be sure that it was not very sensible,
because all living creatures are animals,
and one is just as regular as another, if you
look at it in the right way.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the squirrel, “I think we are
to have a little chat, are we not? It’s you
that must ask the questions, you know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I should so like to,” said Tommy
Smith, “but I promised the mother woodpigeon
to go back and talk to her, and I
am going there now.”</p>

<p>“The mother woodpigeon will be on
her nest for another hour or two,” said the
squirrel, “so you will have time to talk to
her and to me too. And let me tell you, it
is not every little boy who can have a
talk with a squirrel.”</p>

<p>Tommy Smith thought that it was not
every little boy who could have a talk
with a woodpigeon either. But he wanted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
to have both, so he said, “Very well, Mr.
Squirrel, and I hope you will tell me
something interesting about yourself.”</p>

<p>The squirrel only nodded, and said
nothing; and then Tommy Smith remembered
that he had to ask the
questions, so he said, “Why is it, Mr.
Squirrel, that you go to sleep in the
winter? It seems so funny that you
should. I stay awake all the time, you
know&mdash;except at night, of course,&mdash;so why
can’t you?”</p>

<p>“That is easily answered,” said the
squirrel. “You have food in the winter,
don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Of course you do,” said the squirrel.
“It is all got for you, so you have no
trouble. <i>I</i> have to find mine myself, but
in the winter there is none to find. So if I
didn’t go to sleep, I should starve.”</p>

<p>Tommy Smith remembered, then, that
the grass-snake had told him that <i>he</i> went
to sleep in the winter, because he could get
no frogs to eat; and the frog had said <i>he</i>
did, because he could find no insects. So
he saw that there was the same reason
for all these three animals, who were so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
different from each other, doing the same
thing. “And that’s why the dormouse goes
to sleep too, I suppose,” he said to himself,
and then he began to think that if any
other animals went to sleep all the winter,
it must be because <i>they</i> could get no food.</p>

<p>“But I don’t think <i>I could</i> go to sleep if
I was very hungry,” he said to the squirrel;
“and if I did, I’m sure I should wake up
again very soon and want my dinner.”</p>

<p>“I daresay you would,” said the squirrel;
“and if you couldn’t get it, you would soon
die.”</p>

<p>“But do <i>you</i> never wake up and want
<i>your</i> dinner, Mr. Squirrel?” said Tommy
Smith.</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” said the squirrel, “I often
wake up, but whenever I do, I can always
get it. Do you know why? Because I
am such a clever animal, that I hide away
food in the autumn, so that I can find it in
the winter.”</p>

<p>“But you <i>said</i> you couldn’t find food in
the winter,” said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Oh, I meant that I couldn’t find it
growing on the trees and bushes,” said the
squirrel. “Of course I can find what I
have stored away, and that is enough for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
all the time I am awake. But it wouldn’t
be enough for the whole winter, so I sleep
or doze most of the time, and then I don’t
require anything.”</p>

<p>“But why don’t you store away enough
food for the whole winter?” said Tommy
Smith. “Then you needn’t go to sleep at
all, you know.”</p>

<p>“Good gracious!” said the squirrel,
“that would take a great deal too much
time. It is all very well to put a few
things aside, so as to have something to eat
on sunny days&mdash;for those are the days I
like to wake up on,&mdash;but just fancy having
to find dinners beforehand for every day
all through the winter. I could never do
that, you know. One dinner to think
about is quite enough as a rule. How
should you like to have to cook two
dinners every day, and always put one of
them in a cupboard?”</p>

<p>“But you don’t <i>cook your</i> dinners, Mr.
Squirrel,” said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“And <i>you</i> don’t <i>look</i> for <i>yours</i>,” said the
squirrel. “<i>I</i> do. You see,” he went on,
“I only begin hiding things away towards
the end of autumn, so there isn’t so very
much time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>“But you have the rest of the year to
do it in too,” said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Oh no,” said the squirrel; “that’s quite
a mistake. In the spring and summer I
have something else to think about.
Besides, there is nothing worth hiding
away then&mdash;no acorns, or beechnuts, or
filberts, and, of course, one wants to have
something really nice to eat when one
wakes up in the winter. But in the
autumn all those things are ripe. The
autumn is the great eating-time. That is
the time of the year that I like best of all.”</p>

<p>“What! better than the spring or the
summer?” said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Well, in the spring there are buds on
the trees,” the squirrel reflected; “and the
birds’ nests have got eggs inside them.
They are both very nice, though I like
nuts better still. But, you see, buds and
birds’ eggs don’t keep, and so”&mdash;</p>

<p>“Oh but, Mr. Squirrel,” cried Tommy
Smith, “you surely don’t eat the eggs of
the poor birds! Oh, I hope you don’t!”
(You see he was not at all the same
Tommy Smith now that he used to be,
and he didn’t go birds’-nesting any more.)</p>

<p>The squirrel looked just a little bit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
ashamed. “I wouldn’t, you know,” he
said, “if they didn’t make their nests in
the trees.”</p>

<p>“Of course they make their nests in the
trees!” said Tommy Smith indignantly.
“They have just as much right to the
trees as you have, and I think it is very
wicked of you to eat their eggs.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it is,” said the squirrel; “but,
you see, I get so hungry, and fresh eggs
are so nice. By the bye, on what tree did
you say the woodpigeon was sitting? I
think I will go there with you.”</p>

<p>“<i>Indeed</i>, you shan’t!” said Tommy
Smith (and he was <i>very</i> angry). “I won’t
take you there. You want to eat her eggs,
I know; and I think you are a very
naughty animal.”</p>

<p>The squirrel looked at Tommy Smith
for a little while without speaking, and
then he said, “You know, <i>I</i> never eat
hen’s eggs.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you?” said Tommy Smith. It
was all he could think of to say, for he
remembered that <i>he did</i> eat hen’s eggs.
Of course he knew that that was different&mdash;the
peewit had told him that it was&mdash;but
just at that moment he couldn’t think of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
<i>why</i> it was different, and he couldn’t help
wishing that he hadn’t been <i>quite</i> so angry
with the squirrel. “Perhaps you don’t eat
too many eggs,” he said in a milder tone.</p>

<p>“Of course not,” said the squirrel.
“Wherever there are plenty of squirrels,
there are plenty of birds too, as long as
people with guns don’t shoot them. That
shows that we don’t eat too many. And
then, as for our killing trees”&mdash;</p>

<p>“Oh, but <i>do</i> you kill trees?” said
Tommy Smith. “I didn’t know that you
did that.”</p>

<p>“Why, sometimes when we are very
hungry,” said the squirrel, “we gnaw the
bark all round the trunk of a small tree,
and then it dies. So those people who are
always finding out reasons for killing
animals say we do harm to the forests.
But I can tell them this, that no forest was
ever cut down by the squirrels that lived
in it. Men cut down the forests, and
shoot the birds and the squirrels; but if
they left them all three alone, they would
all get on very well together. Once, you
know, almost the whole of England was
covered with forests. Do you think it was
the squirrels who cut them all down?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh no,” said Tommy Smith. “It was
men with axes, I should think.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the squirrel. “It is that
great axe of theirs that does the mischief,
not these poor little teeth of mine. It is
axes, not squirrels, that they should keep
out of the woods.”</p>

<p>Tommy Smith thought the squirrel
might be right, but he wanted to hear
something more about what he did and
the way he lived, so he said, “Oh, Mr.
Squirrel, you haven’t told me where you
hide the nuts and acorns that you eat
when you wake up in the winter.”</p>

<p>“Oh, in all sorts of places,” said the
squirrel. “Sometimes I scrape a hole in
the ground and bury them in it, and sometimes
I put them into holes in the trunks
of trees, or under their roots, if they run
along the ground, or into any other little
nook or crevice near where I live. In fact,
I put them anywhere where it is convenient,
but <i>not</i> where it is <i>in</i>convenient.
That is another of my clever notions.”</p>

<p>“But isn’t it rather difficult to find them
again when you wake up a long time
afterwards?” said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“It would be to you, I daresay,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
the squirrel; “but it is quite easy to me.
You see, I have a wonderful memory, and
never forget where I once put a thing.
Even when the snow is on the ground, I
know where my dinner is. It is <i>under</i>
a white tablecloth then, instead of being
<i>upon</i> one. I have only to lift up the tablecloth,
and there it is.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that you scrape the
snow away, Mr. Squirrel?” said Tommy
Smith.</p>

<p>“Yes, that is what I mean,” said the
squirrel; “but I like to talk prettily.
Well, have you anything else to ask me?
You had better make haste if you have,
because we squirrels can never stay still
for very long, and I shall soon have to
jump away. Look how my tail is whisking.
I always go very soon after that
begins.”</p>

<p>Tommy Smith thought that, as the
squirrel had proposed having a chat himself,
and had prevented him from going on
to the woodpigeon, it was not quite polite
of him to be so very impatient. But he
thought <i>he</i> would be polite, at anyrate, so
he went on, all in a hurry, “I suppose, Mr.
Squirrel, as you go to sleep in the winter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
you have to come out of the trees and find
a place on the ground to”&mdash;</p>

<p>“Out of the trees!” exclaimed the
squirrel. “I should think not, indeed.
That would be very unsafe. Besides, I
should never feel comfortable if I did not
rock with the wind when I was asleep. I
should have a nasty fixed feeling, which
would wake me up every minute.”</p>

<p>This surprised Tommy Smith a good
deal. He knew that squirrels lived in the
trees all day, but he did not know before
that they slept in them at night too.
“Then do you make a nest like a bird,
Mr. Squirrel?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Like a bird, indeed!” said the squirrel.
“No; I make one like a squirrel. It is not
necessary for me to imitate a bird. We
squirrels can make nests a great deal
better than birds can.”</p>

<p>Tommy Smith did not quite believe
this. At anyrate, he felt sure that a
squirrel could not make a better nest than
some birds can. But he remembered that
some other birds make only slight nests,
or none at all. “And perhaps,” he thought,
“he only means those kinds of birds.”
But he thought he had better not ask the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
squirrel this, in case he should be offended,
so he only said, “Oh, Mr. Squirrel, will
you please tell me all about your nest, and
how you make it, and what it looks like.”</p>

<p>“Well,” the squirrel began, “it is very
large; much larger than you would ever
think, to look at <i>me</i>. I could get inside
the cap you have on your head. But how
large do you think the house I make, and
go to sleep in, is?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it is a little larger than my
cap,” said Tommy Smith. He did not
think it could be <i>much</i> larger.</p>

<p>“Why,” said the squirrel, “it is larger
than you sometimes. You know those
great heaps of hay that stand in the fields&mdash;haycocks
I think they call them,&mdash;well,
if you were to take my house to pieces,
it would sometimes make a heap almost
as big as one of them.”</p>

<p>“Would it, really?” said Tommy Smith.
“But why is it so large?”</p>

<p>“You see,” said the squirrel, “if the
walls were not nice and thick, they would
not keep out the cold properly, and so I
have to find a great deal of moss and
grass, and a great many sticks and leaves,
to make it with. Then I have to repair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
it every year&mdash;it would be too much
trouble, you know, to build a new one,&mdash;and
so it keeps on getting bigger, because
of the fresh sticks and things I bring to
it. That is why my house is so large.”</p>

<p>“And are you always quite comfortable
inside it?” said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” said the squirrel; “always
comfortable, and always dry. I knit
everything so closely together, that neither
the rain nor the snow can get through.”</p>

<p>“I suppose your house has a door to
get in and out by,” said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“It has <i>two</i> doors,” said the squirrel,
“a large one and a small one. Why,
what a question to ask! You will be
asking if it has a roof to it next.”</p>

<p>“<i>Has</i> it a roof?” said Tommy Smith.
(So, you see, the squirrel was quite right.)</p>

<p>“Of course it has,” said the squirrel.
“The idea of living in a house without a
roof to it! I build it high up in the
fork of a tree,” he went on; “and I lie
curled up inside it, as snug and as warm
as can be.”</p>

<p>“But isn’t it too warm in the summer?”
asked Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t go into it then,” said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
squirrel. “The house I have been telling
you about is for the winter, but in the summer
I have my summer-house to go into.”</p>

<p>“Oh, then you have two houses!” said
Tommy Smith. “That is cleverer than
a bird, for they have only one nest.”</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> have two,” said the squirrel, “and
they are not at all the same.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do tell me what the summer-house
is like,” said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“It is more lightly built than the winter-house,”
said the squirrel, “and not nearly
so large. That is how summer-houses
are always built, you know. Perhaps you
have one in your garden.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, we have,” said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“And isn’t it much smaller than the
other one?” said the squirrel.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, it is,” said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the squirrel, “my summer-house
is constructed on the same principle.
I will show it you, if you like, for I really
can’t sit still any longer. Just <i>look</i> at
my tail! It will whisk itself off soon if
I don’t jump about.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I should so like to see it, Mr.
Squirrel!” cried Tommy Smith. “Yes,
do come down, and”&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not coming down,” said the
squirrel. “I shouldn’t think of doing that.
I shall go home by the treeway, and you
can walk underneath me. Now then!”
And as the squirrel said this, he gave his
tail <i>such</i> a whisking, and away he ran
along the branch he had been sitting on,
right to the end of it, and then gave <i>such</i>
a jump on to the branch of another tree,
and then out of that tree into another one,
and so from tree to tree, so fast that
Tommy Smith could hardly keep up
with him as he ran along the ground
underneath.</p>

<p>It was not always that the squirrel had
to jump from one tree to another, because
their branches often touched each other,
and then he would run along them
without jumping at all. Sometimes they
would be very near together without
quite touching, and then when he came
to the end of the branch he was on, he
would lean forward, and, with his little
fore-paws, catch hold of the tips of several
of those belonging to another tree, and
draw them all together, and then give a
little spring amongst them, and away he
would go again. This was when he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
in the fir trees. But to see him run down
the long, drooping branch of a beech tree,
right to the very end, and then drop off
it on to another one far below&mdash;that was
the finest sight of all. He did it so very
gracefully. His tail was not turned up
over his back now, as it had been whilst
he was sitting up, but went streaming
out behind him like a flag. And sometimes
he would whisk it from side to side,
and say, “Sug, sug,&mdash;sug, sug,&mdash;sug, sug,
sug, sug, sug!”</p>

<p>“Here it is!” cried the squirrel at last,
from one of the very top branches of the
tree he was on (it was a large beech tree).
“Here is ‘Tree-tops.’ Can you see it?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, I can see the top of the tree
you are on,” said Tommy Smith; “but”&mdash;</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t mean that!” said the
squirrel. “‘Tree-tops’ is the name of my
residence. You know, houses have usually
a name of some sort. So I call mine
‘Tree-tops.’ That describes it very well,
because it is in a tree-top, and there are
tree-tops all round it.”</p>

<p>“But aren’t all squirrels’ nests like
that?” said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” said the squirrel; “and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
can all be called ‘Tree-tops.’ I daresay
you’ve seen more than one house that
was named ‘The Elms,’ or ‘The Firs,’ or
‘The Beeches.’ But now look about, and
see if you can see my summer-house.”</p>

<p>Tommy Smith looked all about near
where the squirrel was sitting high up in
the tree, and at last he saw something
that looked like a little black ball. “Is
that it?” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the squirrel, “that’s it.
Look! Now I am in it,” and he made
a little spring at the ball of sticks, and
disappeared inside it. The jump made
the thin end of the branch swing about,
and the squirrel’s summer-house swung
with it, so that it looked as if it might
be shaken off.</p>

<p>“Oh, do come out,” Tommy Smith
cried. “I’m sure it can’t be safe in there.”</p>

<p>“Not safe!” said the squirrel, as he
poked his little head out, and looked down
at Tommy Smith. “Do you think I would
live with all my family in a house that was
not safe? I have a wife and five children,
you know, and we all live here together.”</p>

<p>“Do you really, Mr. Squirrel?” said
Tommy Smith, for he could hardly believe it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, of course we do,” said the
squirrel; “and great fun it is, too. You
should see how we swing about in a high
wind. Delightful!”</p>

<p>Tommy Smith thought that it would
make <i>him</i> giddy. “It <i>must</i> be dangerous,”
he said. “Suppose you were all to be
swung out, or the branch were to be
blown off, or”&mdash;</p>

<p>“Oh, we never think of such things,”
said the squirrel. “They are sure not
to happen; and even if they did, we should
be all right, somehow, I daresay.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you would,” said Tommy
Smith. “The woodpigeon might, perhaps,
but, you see, you can’t fly, and
so”&mdash;</p>

<p>“Oh, can’t I?” said the squirrel. “Why,
how did I get here then, from tree to tree?
Didn’t you see me?”</p>

<p>“Oh, but that was jumping,” said Tommy
Smith.</p>

<p>“Jumping? Nonsense!” said the squirrel.
“Why, I went through the air, you know,
and that is just what one does when one
flies, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, of course,” said Tommy Smith,
“but”&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>“Very well,” said the squirrel; “then
when <i>I</i> jump, I fly.”</p>

<p>“But you haven’t got wings,” said Tommy
Smith. He knew he was right, but he
didn’t know how to prove it.</p>

<p>“That makes it all the more clever of
me,” said the squirrel. “It is easy enough
to fly if you have wings, but very difficult
indeed if you haven’t. But we squirrels
are a clever family, and can do anything.
Why, one of us is called the ‘Flying
Squirrel,’ you know; and why should he
be called a flying squirrel if he can’t fly?
Not fly? Why, look here!&mdash;look here!&mdash;look
here!”&mdash;and at each “look here!”
the squirrel was in a different tree, and still
he went on jumping, or flying (which do
<i>you</i> think it was?), from one to another,
until very soon he was quite out of sight.</p>

<p>And he never came back&mdash;at least not
whilst Tommy Smith was there. I think
he must have come back at <i>some</i> time or
other, to sit in his little summer-house
again with his wife and children. But
Tommy Smith had not time enough to
wait for him; so, as soon as he was sure
that he was really gone, he walked away to
his friend the woodpigeon.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="small">THE BARN-OWL</span></h2>

<p class="pp6q">“<i>In at Tommy Smith’s window the owl has a peep;<br />
He talks to him wisely, and leaves him asleep.</i>”</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">IT was just the very exact time for a
little boy like Tommy Smith to have
been in bed for about five minutes (your
mother will know <i>what</i> time it was); so,
of course, he <i>had</i> been in bed for about
five minutes, and he wasn’t asleep yet. It
was a beautiful night, the window was
open a little at the top, and Tommy Smith
was looking through it, right away to where
the moon and the stars were shining. All
at once a great white bird flitted across the
window&mdash;so silently!&mdash;without making any
noise at all. Most birds, you know, make
a swishing with their wings, which you can
hear when you are close to them (sometimes
when a good way off too, like the
peewit), but this bird made none at all.</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Tommy Smith, “whatever
was that?” As he said this, the great
white bird flew back again, but&mdash;just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
fancy!&mdash;instead of passing by the window
as it did before, it flew up on to it, and sat
with its head inside the room, looking at
Tommy Smith. “Oh, who are you?” said
Tommy Smith. And yet he knew quite
well that it was an owl. No other bird
could have such great, round eyes, and such
a funny wise-looking face.</p>

<p>The owl sat looking at Tommy Smith
for a little while, and then he said in a very
wise tone of voice, “Guess who I am.”</p>

<p>“I think you are the owl,” said Tommy
Smith.</p>

<p>“That is right,” said the owl. “But what
kind of owl do you think I am?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Tommy Smith, “I suppose
you are the owl that says ‘Tu whit, tu
whoo.’”</p>

<p>“I am <i>not</i>,” said the owl very decisively.
“I have never said anything so absurd in
the whole of my life. Why, what does it
mean? Nothing, <i>I</i> should say. It has
simply <i>no</i> meaning. What I <i>do</i> say is
‘Shrirr-r-r-r,’ which is very different, is it
not now?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Tommy Smith, “it is very
<i>different</i>, but”&mdash;</p>

<p>“Of course it is,” said the owl; “when I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
say <i>that</i>, I feel that I am making a sensible
remark.”</p>

<p>Tommy Smith didn’t think that
“shrirr-r-r-r” was a <i>much</i> more sensible
remark than “tu whit, tu whoo,” but he
thought he had better not say so, as the
owl spoke so positively.</p>

<p>“There are a great many different kinds
of owls in the world, you know,” the barn-owl
continued. “Some are very large, as
large as an eagle, and others are a good
deal smaller than I am. Here, in England,
there are three kinds,&mdash;the wood-owl, the
tawny owl (I can’t answer for what <i>they</i>
say), and the barn-owl. Now <i>I</i>, thank
goodness, am a barn-owl. I must ask you
to remember that, because, naturally, I
shouldn’t like to be mistaken for one of
the others.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m sure I shall remember it,” said
Tommy Smith, “because”&mdash;</p>

<p>“Never mind saying why,” said the owl,
“it would take too long. Well, and were
you surprised to see me?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, I was a little,” said Tommy
Smith. “I just looked up, and I saw a great
white thing going past the window.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I looked white to you,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
the owl; “but that is because <i>you</i> are not
nocturnal, as I am. But, if you were an
owl, like me, you would see that I am not
really white. At anyrate, there is more of
me that isn’t white, than that is. My face
is white, I know,&mdash;these beautiful, soft, silky
feathers that make two circles round my
fine dark eyes,&mdash;my face-discs they are
called (what a pity you can’t see them
better!), <i>they</i> are white, and very handsome
they look. I am very proud of them, for
I am the only owl in England that has
them. But, after all, my face, though it is
beautiful, is only a small part of me. My
back, which is much larger, is not white at
all, but a light reddish yellow. There,
now you get the moonlight on it nicely.
Such pretty, delicate colouring. What a
pity you are not nocturnal! Then, even
my breast is not quite white. It has some
very pretty grey tints about it. And yet
I am called the ‘white owl,’ as well as the
‘barn-owl,’ and often that name is put first
in books. It is very annoying. The barn-owl
is a good sensible name; for I do know
something about barns, and I am very fond
of catching the mice that live in them.
But why should I be called white, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
I have such pretty colours? It is one of
my grievances. You know I have a good
many grievances.”</p>

<p>“Have you?” said Tommy Smith. (He
knew what a grievance was; one of those
things that ought never to be made out of
anything.)</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the owl; “and do you know
what I do with them?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Tommy Smith. He didn’t
<i>quite</i> understand what the owl meant.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the owl&mdash;“mind, I’m going
to say something very wise now (you know
I’m an owl),&mdash;I put up with them.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the owl. “It will take you
a very long time to find out what a wise
remark that was. <i>You</i> couldn’t have made
it, you know; I mean, of course, with the
proper expression. I couldn’t myself <i>once</i>,
when I was only a young owl, but now
that I am grown up, and have a wife and
family to assist me, I can.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” said Tommy Smith. (It was
all he could think of to say.)</p>

<p>“You’ve no idea,” the owl went on,
“what a time it takes one to make <i>some</i>
remarks properly. Now take, for instance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
the one, ‘It’s a sad world!’ It <i>seems</i> very
easy, but even if you were to repeat it a
hundred times a day for the next fortnight,
you wouldn’t be able to say it in the way
it ought to be said&mdash;like this,” and the owl
snapped his beak, and said it again. “<i>That</i>
sounds <i>convincing</i>,” he remarked; “but as
for a little boy saying it in <i>that</i> way,&mdash;no,
no.”</p>

<p>“Is it so <i>very</i> difficult,” said Tommy
Smith.</p>

<p>“Well, it wants help,” said the owl;
“that’s the principal thing. If you were
left to yourself, you’d never manage it; but
first one person helps you, and then
another, until at last&mdash;after a good many
years, you know&mdash;you get into the way
of it. It’s like shrugging one’s shoulders.
It takes one half a lifetime to do <i>that</i>&mdash;<i>well</i>.”</p>

<p>“Does it?” said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Ask your father,” said the owl; “only
you mustn’t expect him to make such a
wise answer as I should, because, of course,
he isn’t an owl, like me.”</p>

<p>Tommy Smith didn’t think the owl had
said anything so <i>very</i> wise, but he had
used a word twice which he didn’t know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
the meaning of, and so he said, “Please,
Mr. Owl, what does being ‘nocturnal’
mean?”</p>

<p>“To be nocturnal,” said the owl, “is to
wake up and see at night, and go to bed
in the daytime, which is what we owls do.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, I know,” said Tommy Smith;
“and if an owl ever <i>does</i> come out in the
daytime, a lot of little birds fly after him
and”&mdash;</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the owl. “It is very grand,
is it not, to be attended in that way?
Common birds have to fly about by themselves,
but, of course, when one is a great
owl, it is natural that people should make
a fuss about one.”</p>

<p>“But, Mr. Owl,” said Tommy Smith (he
really couldn’t help saying this, though he
was afraid the owl might be angry), “don’t
the little birds fly after you because they
don’t like you, and”&mdash;</p>

<p>“Dear, dear!” said the owl, “what funny
notions little boys do get into their heads.
Not like me, don’t they? That is very
ungrateful of them, because <i>I</i> like <i>them</i>
very much. Sometimes I like them almost
as much as a mouse, you know. But, after
all, what does it matter whether they like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
me or not? The important thing is to
have a retinue, all the rest is of no consequence.
Why do you suppose”&mdash;The
owl stopped all of a sudden, as if he had
just thought of something, and then he
said, “But, perhaps, hearing so many wise
things, one after the other, in such a short
time, may be bad for you,&mdash;too much
strain on the brain, you know. What do
you think?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t think it will do me any
harm,” said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the owl; “in the cool
of the night, perhaps, it may not, but I
wouldn’t answer for it in the daytime, if
the sun was at all hot. Well, now do you
suppose that if all the people in the world
who had retinues were to know what their
retinues thought about them, they would
be any the happier for it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the owl (I really cannot tell
you how wise he looked as he said this),
“<i>I do</i>.”</p>

<p>“But what <i>is</i> a retinue?” asked Tommy
Smith.</p>

<p>“Oh dear,” said the owl, “I have been
forgetting that I am a wise owl, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
you are only a little boy who doesn’t know
long words. A retinue is an <i>entourage</i>,
you know, and”&mdash;</p>

<p>“But I don’t know what that word
means either,” said Tommy Smith (and,
indeed, he thought it was rather a more
difficult one than the other).</p>

<p>“Oh dear,” said the owl, “I am forgetting
again. Why, when there are a lot of little
birds, who fly round you and twitter
whenever you come out and show yourself,
that is what I call having a retinue or
an <i>entourage</i>; and, depend upon it, it is
a very grand thing to have. The more
birds there are to twitter about you, the
grander bird <i>you</i> are. But it doesn’t so
much matter <i>what</i> they twitter, and as for
what they <i>think</i>, you had better know
nothing at all about <i>that</i>.”</p>

<p>It was all very well for the owl to talk
in this very wise way, but Tommy Smith
felt sure that the little birds didn’t like him
at all, and only flew round him to annoy
him when he happened to come out in the
daytime. And he didn’t think it was
such a very grand thing to have a retinue
like that. “They would peck at him too,
I daresay, if they weren’t afraid,” he said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
to himself; “and no wonder, if he eats
them.” But he wasn’t quite sure whether
the owl did this or not, so he thought he
had better ask him before feeling angry
with him.</p>

<p>“<i>Do</i> you eat the little birds, Mr. Owl?”
he said.</p>

<p>“Not very often,” the owl answered.
“The fact is, I don’t so <i>very</i> much care
about them. Only, sometimes, when I
want a change of diet, or if they happen
to get in my way, I like to try them.
They can’t complain of <i>that</i>, you know.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“They haven’t time,” said the owl.
“You see, I catch them asleep, and by the
time they wake up, they’ve been eaten.”</p>

<p>“I think it’s a great <i>shame</i>,” said Tommy
Smith; “and I think you’re a <i>wicked</i> bird
to do it. You ought to be shot for doing
such things, and when I am grown up, and
have a gun”&mdash;</p>

<p>“Wait a bit,” said the owl. “Do you
know what you would be doing if you were
to shoot me? Why, you would be shooting
the most useful bird in the whole
country. You wouldn’t want to do <i>that</i>, I
suppose?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>Tommy Smith didn’t quite know what
to say to this. “Of course, if you really
<i>are</i> very useful,” he began&mdash;</p>

<p>“Well, if you were a farmer,” the owl
went on, “I don’t suppose you would like
to have all your corn, and wheat, and hay,
and everything eaten up by rats and mice,
would you?”</p>

<p>“Oh no,” said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“That is what would happen, though, if
it wasn’t for me,” said the owl. “You see,
<i>I</i> eat the rats and mice. They are my
proper food, especially the mice. A full-grown
rat is rather large for me&mdash;too large
to swallow whole, at anyrate; and I like to
swallow things whole if I can. But the
mice and the young rats are just the right
size, and you’ve no idea what a lot of them
I eat. I have a very good appetite, I can
tell you, and so have my children. Of
course, I have to feed them as well as
myself, so there is plenty of work for me
to do. Every night I fly round the fields
and farmyards, and when I see a mouse,
or a rat, or a mole, or a shrew-mouse,
down I pounce upon it. Now think how
many owls there are all over the country,
and think what thousands and thousands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
of rats and mice they must catch every
night, and then think what a lot of good
they must do. Or, here is another way.
Think how many rats and mice there are
even now, although there are so many owls
to catch them, and think how much harm
they do, and think how many more there
would be, and how much more harm they
would do if there were no owls to catch
them. That is a lot of thinking is it not?
Well, have you thought of it all?”</p>

<p>“I’ve tried to,” said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“It’s difficult, isn’t it?” said the owl.
“It’s all very well to say ‘think,’ but the
fact is, you <i>can’t</i> think what a useful bird
an owl is&mdash;and especially a barn-owl. But,
perhaps, you don’t believe me.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, I do,” said Tommy Smith.
“I always thought that owls killed rats
and mice.”</p>

<p>“You can prove it, if you like,” said the
owl, “and I’ll tell you how. I told you
that I liked to swallow animals whole,
so, of course, everything goes down&mdash;fur,
bones, feathers (if it does happen to be a
bird), and all. But I can’t be expected to
digest such things as that, so I have to get
rid of them in some way or other. Well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
what do I do? Why, I bring them all up
again in pellets about the size and shape
of a potato.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but potatoes are of different sizes
and shapes,” said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> mean a smallish-sized oblong potato,”
said the owl. “That is what my pellets
look like, only they are of a greyish sort
of colour. Sometimes they are quite
silvery.”</p>

<p>“How funny!” said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“How pretty, I suppose you mean,”
said the owl. “Yes, they <i>are</i> pretty.
Now, if you look about under the trees
in the fields where I have been sitting,
you will see these pretty pellets of mine
lying on the grass. Pick them up and
pull them to pieces, and you will find that
they are nothing but the fur, and skulls,
and bones of mice, and shrew-mice, and
young rats. Sometimes the skull and beak
of a bird will be there, and then it will
almost always be a sparrow’s. Sparrows
are a nuisance, you know, because there
are too many of them. But, as for mice,
there will be three or four of them in
every pellet (you can count them by the
skulls), and you know what a nuisance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
<i>they</i> are. Let anyone who is not quite
sure whether I am a useful bird or not
look at my pellets. Then he’ll know, and
if he shoots me after that, he must either
be very stupid, or very wicked, or both.
Well, do you still mean to shoot me when
you grow up?”</p>

<p>“Oh no,” said Tommy Smith, “I never
will, now that I know how useful you are,
and what a lot of good you do.”</p>

<p>The owl looked very pleased at this, so
Tommy Smith thought he would take the
opportunity to ask his advice about something
which had been puzzling him a good
deal. “Please, Mr. Owl,” he said, “I promised
the rat not to kill him any more. But, if rats
and mice do such a lot of harm, oughtn’t I
to kill them whenever I can?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” said the owl. “A little
boy should be kind to animals, and not
trouble his head about anything else. No,
no; be kind to animals and leave the rats
and mice to <i>me</i>.” That was the wise owl’s
advice to Tommy Smith, and <i>I</i> think it
was very good advice.</p>

<p>“Where do you live, Mr. Owl?” (that
was the next question that Tommy Smith
asked). “I suppose it is in the woods.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>“No,” the owl answered. “Barn-owls
do not live in the woods. The tawny-owls
and the wood-owls do. Woods are good
enough for them, but we like to have more
comfortable surroundings. We don’t object
to trees, of course. A nice hollow tree is
a great comfort, and I, for one, could not
do without it. But it must be within a
reasonable distance of a village, and the
closer it is to a church, the better I like it.”</p>

<p>“Do you, Mr. Owl,” said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the owl. “I don’t mind
how far I am from a railway station or
even a post office, but the church <i>must</i> be
near.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you like to sit in the tower,
Mr. Owl,” said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“I should think so,” said the owl; “the
belfry is there, you know, and I am so
fond of that. It is so nice to sit in one’s
belfry and think of one’s barns, and farms,
and haystacks. And then, when the bells
ring, you can’t think what fun that is&mdash;especially
on the first day of January
when they ring in the New Year. I get
quite excited then, and I give a scream,
and throw myself off the old tower, and fly
round it, and whoop and shriek until I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
seem to be one of the mad bells myself.
For they <i>are</i> mad then, you know. They
go mad once every year&mdash;on New Year’s
day. People come out to listen sometimes.
They look up into the air, and
say, ‘Hark! There they go. It is the
New Year now. They are ringing it in.’
Then all at once the bells stop ringing,
and it is all over; the New Year has been
rung in. But what there is new about it
is more than <i>I</i> can say, wise as I am. It
all seems to go on just the same as before,
and sometimes I wonder what all the fuss
has been about. I have never been able
to see any difference myself between the
last minute of the thirty-first of December
and the first minute of the first of January.
On a cold rainy night especially, they seem
very much alike. But, of course, there
must <i>be</i> a difference, or the bells wouldn’t
ring as they do.”</p>

<p>“Oh, they ring because it’s the new
year, Mr. Owl,” said Tommy Smith.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s it,” said the owl; “but I
should never have found it out without
them.”</p>

<p>Tommy Smith began to think that
the owl couldn’t be so <i>very</i> wise after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
all, or surely he would have known the
difference between the old year and the
new year. He was going to explain it
to him thoroughly, but he was getting
rather sleepy by this time, and it is
difficult to explain things when one is
sleepy.</p>

<p>So he didn’t, and the owl went on
with, “Oh yes, we love churches, we
owls do. We have our nests there, you
know, and we could not find a safer
place to make them in. Anywhere else
we might be disturbed and rudely treated,
for people are not nearly so polite to us
as they ought to be. But we are always
safe in a church, for no one would be
so wicked as to annoy us there. Besides,
a church is a wonderful place to hide
in. People pass by it, and come into
it, and sit down and go out again,
without having any idea that we are
there, and have been there all the time.
They never think of that.”</p>

<p>“What part of the church do you
build your nest in, Mr. Owl?” said Tommy
Smith.</p>

<p>“Oh, that is in the belfry too,” said
the owl. “The belfry is my part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
church. I think it must have been built
for me, it suits me so well. I am called
the belfry-owl sometimes, and that is a
very good name for me too. But now
don’t ask me any more questions, because
you are getting sleepy, and I have something
to tell you before you go to sleep.”</p>

<p>And then the owl told all about the
grand meeting that the animals had held
in the woods, and all that they had said
to each other, and what they had decided
to do to try and make Tommy Smith a
better boy to animals, and how, at first,
they had wanted to hurt him (or even
to kill him), because they were so angry
with him, until the owl had persuaded
them not to. It was all the wise owl’s
doing. <i>He</i> knew that the best way to
make a little boy kind to animals was
to teach him something about them;
and who could teach him so well as
the animals themselves?</p>

<span class="small">THE LEAVE-TAKING</span></h2>

<p class="pp6q">“<i>All ‘Tommy Smith’s Animals’ take leave with joy</i>,<br />
<i>For they know Tommy Smith is a different boy</i>.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">WHEN Tommy Smith had gone to
sleep, the owl flew away, and he
flew to the same place where he had
met the other animals before, and found
them all there again waiting for him (of
course, it had been arranged). Then
all the animals began to tell each other
about the conversations they had had
with Tommy Smith, and what a very
much better boy he had become. They
were all so glad; and, of course, they all
thanked the owl, because it had been
his idea.</p>

<p>Then the owl thanked all the animals
for thanking <i>him</i>, and he said that it <i>was</i>
his idea, but that it might just as well
have been the idea of any other animal
there, and he wished that it <i>had</i> been,
because, <i>then</i>, he could have called it
clever, but <i>now</i>, of course, he couldn’t,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
for <i>that</i> would be praising himself,&mdash;which
would <i>never</i> do. You see, he wanted to
be modest. One ought always to be
modest when one makes a speech. And
now (the owl said) he was quite sure
that Tommy Smith would never be
unkind to animals any more as long as
he lived, because, just before he flew
away, he had asked him to promise that
he wouldn’t. But Tommy Smith had
just gone off to sleep then, and so he
had had to promise it in his sleep.
“And, you know,” said the owl, “that
when a promise is made in <i>that</i> way, it
is always kept.” Then all the animals
clapped their&mdash;well, whatever they could
clap, and said “Hurrah!” and the
meeting broke up.</p>

<p>And the owl was right. As Tommy
Smith grew older, and became a big
boy, he found that animals did not talk
to him any more in the way they used
to do. It seemed as if they only cared
to talk to <i>little</i> boys or girls. But there
was one way of having conversations
with them, which he got to like better
and better, and that was to go out into
the woods and fields and watch what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
they were doing. He soon found that
that was quite as interesting as really
talking to them. In fact, it <i>was</i> talking
to them in another kind of way, for
they kept telling him all about themselves,
only without speaking. And the
more Tommy Smith learnt about them,
the more he liked them, until the animals
became his very best friends. Of course,
one is never unkind to one’s very best
friends, and, besides, Tommy Smith had
given the owl a promise&mdash;in his sleep.</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
